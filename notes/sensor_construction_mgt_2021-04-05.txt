look at repo
documentation for data loggers

03_3_mayfly_datalogger.md and on
any of the 03 files

communicating with the mayfly via usb
will need to install a driver

will probably (likely) need to do the SDI-12 protocol
look in the file
this is what will take the longest amount of time

03_7_deployment ...

also look in UAV-b-data-loggers repo
all of these are based on arduino

cpp syntax
install an arduino compiler
(can find on youtube?)

03_5_mayfly_datalogger.md may also have some instructions that would be useful vis a vi setups
DON'T do the tutorials listed in # Getting Started
don't set it up the same way that they're outlined in the tutorials in that file
do 1-2 basic arduino tutorials (arduino.cc, the first link in that file)
like a hello world type tutorial and then rely on the rest of the repo for that
the best deployment code available is SP510_deplooy/SP510_deploy.ino in data loggers repo
maybe plus some additional setup for sdi12

loop (l 73) is what's doing the actual readers

maybe do this Example_03_Modify_temp.cpp ex. in the uav-b-dataloggers repo

can probably follow "logging mayfly with decagon sd12..."
https://www.envirodiy.org/topic/logging-mayfly-with-decagon-sdi-12-sensor/
don't do the 6:43 entry about manual installation
just find the code that does this correctly and figure out how to modify it

coding styles: an object oriented library (reqs a library for the particular sensor)
they have written a library, our job is just to pick it out
look at the code on the 11:03 post
take what is required to run this script in the library, import those
we need any methods from the mSDI12 object (mySD12.method())
all of these functions needed will go into this script at the head (before the first call so mySDI12)

go to Brett and get the loggers
bring him moisture sensors

use neon towers to monitor snowmelt (phenocams at C1)
