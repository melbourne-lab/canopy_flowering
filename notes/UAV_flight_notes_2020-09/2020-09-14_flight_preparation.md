# Preliminary plan for drone flight on September 15, 2020.

#### Present: Scott, Anna, Matt, Airy (everyone is planning on driving separately).

Current plan is to arrive at the meadows around 8 am. We'll start by shooting ~10 ground control points (GCPs) and putting out orange markers in each of the 72 plots. Once this is done, we will fly a drone over the site. Upon completion, we'll remove the markers and bucket lids and place ribar at the GCPs for future reference.

## Materials needed:

#### For marking plots

* Hammer (would probably work better than pin flags)
* Nails (for affixing ends of markers to ground)
* Markers (between 72 and 144 painted orange strips of canvas)
* Shovel (in case plots are buried in snow)
* Canvas bags

#### For shooting GCPs

* Bucket lids (10)
* Survey grade GPS (Trimble)
* Charged batteries for controller and receiver
* Handheld GPS (for navigating between GCPs)
* Paper map of study site

#### For drone flight

* Drone
* Batteries/battery pack (3?)
* Chargd RC
* Phone with app (using Matt's phone)
* Cable

#### For cleanup

* Hammer
* Rebar (10 - same number as GCPs)
* Rebar caps

#### Other

* Orange hunting vests (available within MRS office building)
* Pen and paper (notes)
* Garmin emergency deice
* Masks
* Water
* Lunch

## Preparation notes

#### Flight

Anna posted a note (not sure where or how - worth maybe putting this in writing somewhere) granting permission to fly. Thanks Anna! Scott also made Bill Bowman aware of the plan.

Flying should take about one hour. It's typically good to do this at solar noon, which is at about 1 pm right now. We'll try to start the flight around noon. 

Wind is predicted to be at 15-20 mph - this is probably the upper boundary of what is safe to fly at. 

#### Costs

Use speedtype (in email) to get gas and material reimbursement. Scott will send Airy instructons for reimbursement.
