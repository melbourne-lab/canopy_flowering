# Paper list

Papers (organized by topic) for future reading in the canopy flowering project. For list of papers with notes, see `notes/paper_notes.md`.

### Soil moisture

##### Dunne et al., 2002. Subalpine meadow flowering... Ecological Monographs.

Looks at nine subalpine plants at RMBL, experimentally monitors change in start and duration of flowering and possible effects of soil temperature, soil moisture, etc.

##### Craine et al., 2011. Flowering phenolgoy as a funcitonal trait... New Phytologist.

Tallgrass prairie community study with details and references about influences about soil moisture on timing of flowering.

##### Reed et al., 2019. Prairie plant phenology driven more by... Ecology and Evolution.

Effects of warming +/ drought on phenology (?) along a latitudional gradient in the coastal Pacific Northwest.

##### Zhu et al., 2016. Interactions between warming and soil moisture... Royal Society Biological Letters.

Experimental warming in plants in the Tibetan plateau.

##### Newman, 1965. Factors affecting the seed production... Journal of Ecology

Skimmed first part. Looks at annual moisture and influence on flower production. Long. May or may not be relevant.

### *Campanula* general notes

##### Preite et al., 2015. Adaptation of flowering phenology and fitness-related traits... Evolutionary Ecology.

*Campanula rotundifolia* taken from across Europe and planted in common garden. Looked at environmental correlations, some genetic analysis, looking at some phenological metrics.

### Meadow dynamics

##### Haugo and Halpern, 2007. Vegetation responses to conifer encroachment in a western Cascade meadow: a chronosequence approach. The Canadian Journal of Botany.

### Seed limitation

##### Santandreau, M., and Lloret, F. 1999. Effect of flowering phenology and habitat on pollen limitation in **Erica multiflora**. Canadian Journal of Botany.

Seed set ~ Timing of flowering x shrub/forest habitat. Through the lens of pollination and pollen limitation throughout the season and how this varies by environment. Seems very relevant.

##### Knight, T.M. 2004. Floral density, pollen limitation, and reproductive success in **Trilium grandiflorum.** Oecologia.

Empirical demonstration that floral density affects seed set/pollen limitation.

##### Ludemo, S., and Totland, O. 2007. Within-population spatial variation in pollinator visitaton rates, pollen limitation on seed set, and flower longevity in an alpine species. Acta Oecologica.

Spatial variation in pollen limitation and pollinator visitation!

##### Howe, A.A., et al. 2016. Seed set variation in wild **Clarkia** populations: teasing apart the effects of seasonal resource depletion, pollen quality, and pollen quantity. Ecology and Evolution.

Comparing seed set/outcrossing in early and late flowering plants.
