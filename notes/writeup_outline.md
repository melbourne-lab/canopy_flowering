# Shade write-up outline

August, 2020

### Background and framing

### Theory and predictions

##### Causes of different flowering times

* Possible causes include snowmelt, heat, light
	+ If determined by snow melt, residual soil moisture may also impact physiology (e.g., plant height)
	+ Physiology notes

* The strength of reproductive barriers fluctuate
	+ Soil moisture and heat: may be differential responses to stress under different microhabitats
	+ E.g., in a winter with little precipitation, difference in snowmelt times may be small
	+ E.g., in a warm year, more open areas may show flowering
	+ This means that the reproductive barrier between individuals in different canopy types will vary in strength
		- For years with weak differences, a Wahlund effect occurring
		- Here, environmental autocorrelation and time-lags need to be considered
			* for short-lived species with positive autocorrelation, it is possible to have generations with effective reproductive barriers

* Climate change - how will this change timing effects?
	

##### Population biology considerations

* At individual level, this may reduce seed set
	+ This is especially likely if more individuals are found in one environment type than another
		- If shaded plants are less likely to flower, then tail may have fewer plants and shaded plants may experience seed limitation
		- Or, less oucrossing (more inbreeding) with 
	+ One manifestation of this is source-sink dynamics, where, e.g., high-light environment has offspring which are dispersed into lower-light environments 

* Genetic exchange
	+ This is a physical constraint which reduces random mating (reduced N_e)
	+ Effects on genetic variation population-wide
	+ Local adaptation (both in space and in time)
	+ Selection for early flowering time (Munguia Rosas review)

* All aspects of mating are contingent on the pollination biology
	+ What is the scale of pollination? Does it depend on the flower species, or the site?
		- E.g., hummingbirds will transfer genetic material longer distances than bees
	+ Who are the pollinators? Do are they shade-tolerant? 
		- Plants in the shade may not be serviced by pollinators at all.
		- Or, the community may be different, changing effectiveness or distance travelled for pollinators
	+ Notably, for the pollinators who are shade-tolerant, longer phenophase w/ consequences for plant competition over pollinators as well as plant-pollinator network architecture

##### Spatial considerations

* Autocorrelation within the meadow
	+ Positive autocorrelation (e.g., big meadow with well-defined bounds)
		- high local synchrony, nearby mates available at same time
		- with low dispersal, likelihood of nearby genetic similarity
	+ Negative autocorrelation (e.g., patchy spots, savannas) will have higher limitation
		- fewer nearby mates open at same time - seed limitaiton?
		- with low dispersal, likelihood of higher nearby genetic diversity
	+ Here, individual trees have the potential to induce large effects! 
	+ What is the scale of variation relative to scale of other processes?				- e.g., spatial variation relative to dispersal and pollination scales 

* Meadow creeping/encroachment
	+ Meadows are dynamic
		- Typically shrink in slowly
		- Response to this may depend on plasticity vs. heritability of flowering time as a trait
