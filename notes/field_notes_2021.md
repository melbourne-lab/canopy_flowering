# Field notes

(note: field trip from April 3 2021 surveying snow not included for now)

### May 22 2021

Started putting out plots today. File for doing so (currently in very messy form) is `setup/setup_2021/stratify_sampling.R`.
Output is `setup/setup_2021/plot_init_coords.csv` and `setup/setup_2021/plot_raw_full.png`.
This script output a data frame and plot of 90 coordinates, stratified to include all levels of summer direct radiation.

The script was imperfect (randomness) so my protocol was to go in to the field and try to roughly place these plots using the image and landmarks within it. This was almost surely done imperfectly (i.e. not having exact coordinates). 
There are also some points that were assigned right next to each other. I tried to spread these out by moving one (or occasionally both) to another position, trying to pick a position with a similar amount of direct radiation.

I put down 41 plots today, mostly on the East (lower) side. I recorded (for upload soon) the plot number (not included in the files above), whether or not that plot had snow, and whether the plot was established with four corners (white flags only) or with an orange flag nearby due to snow. I only put down one or two plots (i.e. corners thereof) in snow - did not want to disturb the process of melting. Most of these (esp. those in deep snow) were denoted with an orange flag ("orf") and direction *from the flag* to where the plot should be established.

More detail (esp. on snowdepths) to come.

### May 23 2021

Put out another 41 plots using procedures as outlined above. Total of 82 plots this summer.

Aspen/conifer gallery to the north of the bridge connecting East (I guess now Northeast?) and Northwest meadows had spotty/inconsistent snow. The conifer portion to the North and Northwest of the Northwest meadow was much more consistently (>90%) beneath snow - much of it deep. 

Northwest meadow was pretty dry. Southern (larger) part of the Southwest meadow was dry but the smaller Northern arm of the Southwest meadow was beneath a large snowdrift. Aspens to the west were mostly snowed in but there were a few bare patches where I put plots down.

I saw ~five Thermopsis plants emerging from the ground - two in one plot (I think plot 72/73). Lookng back on photos from last year, there were *a lot* of emerging Thermopsis plants on May 26 and they were much higher/larger (no stem visble on any of this year's yet). Suggests to me that there's probably at least seven-ten days before T starts flowering. ~Two of what I saw (included in the count of five) were purple (on/near the steep open area on the Northern boundary). These may be *Mahonia* (Oregon grape). Otherwise I only saw T in the open part of the SW meadow.

I also over the last two days saw a couple (maybe ~six) of what look like well-defined Campanula rosettes. I wonder if they wjust never senesced last year? They're too small to be from this year. It's also possible it's not Campanula - will need to look more closely at leaves next tme. 

This all means that it's probably too late to get moisture measurements before the T appears. But we should get a solid month before the Campanula appears.

I put out some of the flags right on the edge of snowdrifts. Should be intersting to see how much they melt before the next visit (thinking right now that will be Thursday May 27). 

Got snowed on today. That was neat. Not sure how much stuck but it was I guess too cool to get rain. It was in the 70s in Boulder - this suggests that warm weather in Boulder and even supra-freezing in Ned does not guarantee conditions for massive snowmelt. In general it was half sunny half cloudy thoughout the day - definitely conditions for melting when the sun was out but the afternoon shade looked like it wouldn't cause much melt.

### Jun 3 2021

(Written on June 7)

Today: no aspens leafing out anywhere at site, probably a few buds. Snow mostly gone although still some small drifts remaining below canopy (in pine).

I forgot the black sharpie today so some flags placed today (~10) were unlabelled. I used the flag field on the plot placement file.

Two plots were scrapped today: 12 and 15. 12 I couldn't find and 15 I accidentally pulled the flag and forgot where it was supposed to go. So now there are only 80 plots.

Decided today it's not worth tracking old toothpicks. Too much time, too little reward. As such the number of stems is probably not going to be informative (because new ones will pop up). These could be useful for identifying plants if there are doubles I suppose.

On the drive up, there were leafed-out aspens on hurricane hill but nowhere above that. The highest Thermopsis I think I saw flowering was right before the road widening below Boulder Falls (although coming down a lot of these did look like dandelions or mustards).

### Jun 7 2021

Lower aspens were starting to leaf out and upper ones were not.

Plots with adjacent aspens starting to leaf out: 1, 82, 8, 21, 4, 20, 22, 30, 35, 3, 33, 36, 68, 38
Plots with adjacent aspens not leafing out: 28, 9, 43, 39, 29, 31, 56, 64, 63, 81, 78, 76 77

Decided today it's too hard to toothpick Campanula. Both because it's starting now and it would be a lot of added work plus also because they're kinda hard to identify.

There was Thermopsis flowering on the part of Peak to Peak with the viewpoint and maybe even one flowering on the road by the trailhead. But there were none flowering in the meadows (obviously) and no yellow visible so probably another week until they start. Nothing else flowering in meadows except for one Mertensia and whatever that tiny yellow plant was.

All plots have been placed as of today. Work day today was 5.5 hours. Hopefully shorter going forward.

### Jun 10 + Jun 14 2021

Jun 10 took ~4.5 hours. Ending was slightly tight due to approaching flight. 71, 73, 74 may have been rushed due to being at the end and also being watched (?) by an animal (assume deer). 

Nearly all aspens were out save for those above plots 64 (and possibly 63).

First flowering Thermopsis seen - large patches on the eastern edge of the NE meadow (where I recall some of the earliest ones being in 2020) as well as possibly the E edge of the NW meadow. Did see some pollination occurring on one of these few plants in the NW meadow and got a picture.

Nervous that I am missing a good number of merging T plants. Probably an unavoidable problem given constraints. I marked these when recording with an asterisk, and noted them when entering data (jun 14) as something like "possibly prev. missed". Should go through at some point and make changes.

Relatedly there were some data entry issues from June 7.

Jun 14 took about five hours. Aspens are effectively done leafing out and canopy is full. Still seeing plenty of T coming out of the ground. Did see a handful of missed plants.

Thankfully no flowering thus far within plots. I marked a few plants that had yellow visible. I think it is unlikely that these or any others flower by this upcoming Thursday. Regardless no pollinator observations tomorrow (Tues Jun 15).

### Jun 17 2021

Flowering today in a few plots - some of the low 70s (71 and 73 I think) as well as 62 and 8, perhaps others. 8 seems to have advanced phenology for some reason. Not very many new plants although some plots (esp. 1 and 2) seemed to have a lot. No plants in most of the pine plots (50s).

I think my plots will be slightly slower than the modal plots. A lot of flowering is happening in the upper meadows (especially on the part just west of the steep part in the S one) but it's behind in plots. There were very few flowering plants in the large central aspen stand (<10 that I saw) and I didn't notice any with wings spread in any of the other aspen stands aside from plot 8.

Due to scarcity of tags (or at least perceived scarcity) I did not tag YV plants in plots higher than 40. I did note these on the data sheet although without tags - just with toothpicks. I tagged YV plants in lower numbered (downhill) plots. I was never planning on using YV in analysis anyway.

I started up top today and ended down below - really liked this order as it meant the tedious plots were done early in the day. Ending in the aspen stands (4, 20-22) was also nice.

Saw Bombus nevadensis pollinating around plot 6. Also saw another Bombus although it was moving too quickly to detect. No other pollinators observed on Thermopsis. Saw a good number (definitely including small bees, possibly including bumblebees) on Mertensia though.

### Jun 21 2021

Solstice today! Wanted to put out first sensors today but could not - code from a test deployment in Brett's yard was buggy. Ugh.

Today was foggy - low cloud rolling throughout the meadow throughout the entirety of my day. Dew drops on everything, very wet (including flowers). Temperatures in the 40s (47F when I left). No pollinators observed of course.

Moisture made some slight confusion with the toothpicks - it's possible that orange faded to white. But I am confident in the data I collected. I ran a little short on tags again (put out a lot today) so some of the plots had only toothpicks with no tags, but there were few of these.

Pollinator observations starting tomorrow - have 13 plots with plants in them. Will use 12 of them - these 12 will be selected in the datasheet generation script. Protocol will be uploaded soon but briefly - 12 plots, 15 minutes spent watching each for a total of 180 minutes.

### Jun 22 2021

A lot less pollination than I expected. Seems like much less than last year (speculative/observational). Possibly due to cold weather yesterday? But alternatively you may expect there to be more pollination after a bad day...

Need a tight seal on net when catching. Lost a small bee today.

Truly not very many *Bombus* species today. Those I did see were often large - could have been *nevadensis* but some looked to have red (*mixtus* or *appositus*). Were they queens? Are entire colonies active yet?

Flies (incl. syrphs) seemed to prefer the yellow celery type plant and the *Microsteris*-looking plant. Some fed on *Taraxacum*. Saw a *Bombus* and another bee on *Taraxacum*. Bees also like *Mertensia*. Rare switching occuring with a lep (white with orange tipped wings) going *Microsteris* to *Mertensia* (maybe 5-10m around plot 79).

Looks like there's a nest for some bee in the basal sage about 1m N of plot 59.

#### Jun 25

Beautiful day! Not much to observe other than that pollination still appears rare (only saw *B. nevadensis* and maybe a syrph) and that I put in too little effort in checking for new emerging plants. Was wet in the morning.

Lots of *Dodecatheon*, still some *Mertensia* and a few wallflowers. Shaded sunflower (*Arnica*?) is in full swing.

It would be cool to think about movement, specifically encroachment. *T* pops growing/shrinking with encroachment. Some seed broadcasting/addition in different habitat types would be cool and useful. There is some *T* in pine around plot 40 but that's most/all of what I have seen in the interior-ish Northern pine.

Right before leaving I did see a *Bombus* fly in to (but not really stop in) aspens towards plot 4. Very neat!

### Jun 28 2021

Rainy morning - rained when I arrived and cleared up around 8:45. Think that early mornings that would otherwise would be clear will have cloud cover until the sun zaps the clouds away. In any event, no pollinator action until around 11am despite the sky clearing hours before.

Very wet, little progress. Close to no new tags. Seems like most plants had the same number of flowers as before, although there were many exceptions. Seems like there was status advancement (a few YV plants flowering) for those plants already budding but few to no plants starting to bud. Thinking it would be cool to look at cumulative temperature (some proxy for GDD) in relation to emergence of flowers although the microclimate variation (shade) would complicate that considerably, as would the time dependence (early vs. late season).

Hardly checked for new TPs today because of time crunch. There were some previously missed in 74. Ugh - consider ignoring that plot in Tp analysis. Relatedly, had a couple more no-tp plants bud/flower today. Thinking that in the MS these can be noted by saying they were mostly on the boundary and there were questions about being in or not.

### Jun 29 2021

Weather is weird. Didn't start until around 9 but the weather was great, but then it cooled off around 11. This is during the very cool and wet week - temperatures around the 40s. It will be good to use the time of observation as an intercept (note: check that this exists).

Skipped the final plot (9) due to threatening weather. It would have been another observation at 40 degrees showing no observations - would have helped standard error but perhaps not much else.

Grant joined today to check on signs of animal use. Tons of moose signage. Large-ish vertical-running scars on aspens that expose lower layers of bark - caused by teeth (!). There were a few of these that looked very fresh (definitely from this season) in the aspen stand housing 4 and 20-22. There were also some smaller aspen trees toppled, either by pushing them over or by pulling them down while browsing on top layers. There are a few of these that look fresh (bark isn't dried yet) in the same aspen stand. Is this the only area with these signs of browse? This does make me nervous about sensors.

### Jul 1 2021

Emerging plant (toothpick) hunting has been poor recently. Missing lots seen every day. I think there will be too much bias to tell mean emergence dates at each plot. It will still be possible to get first days of emergence, though. I do need to do surveys at the end to get a total toothpick count.

Love the Dodecatheons! Also the columbines are out and doing very well right now - sticking mostly to shaded areas.

Speaking of plants that do well in the shade - the Arnicas (?) look like a shade-adapted species that could be used in a forest movement study. Or perhaps for edge effects? Is this the same species (or one of the species) that Young was studying in the 80s in the Medicine Bow range?

Weather continues to be weird. Was clear when I started around 8 but I got rained on around 10:30 while working on plot 74. Waited in the car for an hour before finishing.

I did a pollinator observation in the plot I missed last time (plot 9). Started at 1:24 pm. Was warm-ish when (or rather right before) I started but it quickly clouded over. Of course, no pollinators observed (ugh). Made me wonder about what the best way to assign a temperature to each observation period would be - the beginning? Averaged over the time window?

I did see a Bombus (one of the small ones - mixtus? didn't get a great look) look at but skip *Thermopsis* but did land on a wallflower in plot 59.

Lots more flowers from Monday to today than there were from last Friday to Monday. Must have been a few good warm-ish days. Makes me wonder about springing and path dependence...

### Jul 3 2021

Wow very much a dogshit day. Tried to put out sensors today. The first and worst was plot 6 - tried both corners and eventually had something off-level that collapsed when trying to fix. In retrospect I think it was because the hose clamp was too high, which let the pole move freely from the bottom and tip over easily. The hose clamp looks like it may be done. I took this unit out of the ground (partially assembled). It's possible that the un-filed bottom damaged the cable for the sensor. Hmm...

Otherwise I successfully installed sensors in plots 19, 25, and 48.

### Jul 5 2021

Typical flowering observations took about three hours. Fewer than ten new tags put out.There were a lot more flowers that finished than in the previous two visits - possibly due to nice weather over the weekend. I think we may be past *Thermopsis* peak. However I am noticing a lot of *Campanula* looking like it will flower in full. Interestingly, I saw these most in the pine forest.

Think it's time to take "done" flowers off the *Thermopsis* sheet. Should also edit the sheet to call any plants with *decreasing* done flowers done (rather than requiring them to be the same) as well as collected tags (I did collect two).

I took out the card for sensor 48 today. For equipment, I brought the cable cutters and extra cards. However, I did not bring  cable ties. If ever doing card and battery swapping while sampling, I'll need to bring these. Otherwise the logger will be dangling. I collected the card by simply slipping a sheet of paper with the plot and SP510 number inside the plastic case for the card. The logger was left dangling from around 11 to 1 pm.

I also tried putting out more sensors today but got rained out. Radar for that area is useless! 

### Jul 7 2021

Pollinator observation day + sensor placement.

Thought at first the pollinator observation was a bust. Maybe it still is? Went today (Wed) instead of yesterday because forecast yesterday looked very bad (although according to Warren there was no rain until the afternoon). Consequently some of the plots selected were done - I had to supplement with other nearby plots (think I swapped 57 in for 59 and 74 in for 73). I didn't see anything early in the day, but I did see stuff later - three *Bombus nevadensis* visits. Saw *B. nevadensis* on some lupines too. Another species (smaller, likely *Bombus flavifrons*) was visiting Mertensia in the lower meadows but was going hog wild in a thick patch of *Thermopsis* by plot 70 - probably saw at least six. Otherwise I saw an orange lep and a house fly but not much else. I did see that missed bee from the first day at some point - seems to be a common pollinator.

It'll be kinda tough to figure out what to use as a predictor in the analysis. Sky view? Hmm...

I put out two more sensors today - plots 67 and 75. Would have put out 77 but I instead looked at the rooting depth of some plots in the adjacent (large south) meadow. Max depth I saw for tissue in either species (looking at 2-3 plants) was maybe only 4cm, as shallow as 3cm. I was looking mostly at rhizomes/runners. I did see some bud-like organ but it was maybe only at 4cm. I think it would be good to place the TEROS probes closer to around 4-5 cm depth instead of 7-8cm. Looking at some of the data from plot 48 (jul 3 - jul 5), at a depth of 7-8 we still see diurnal curves in soil temperature. Hmm..

Also, because I don't think I tightened a bolt enough, the platform in 67 will need to be adjusted upward (which may require some other adjustments... ugh). The level in 67 is finnicky as well - would be good to go in with glue.

OH also - Campanula is up. Saw some open south of plots 37 and 27 (approximate locations of last year's plots 7 and 71 or 72). Also saw some that were going to open soon elsewhere. No buds visible in plots though.

### Jul 8 2021

Standard phenology day. No sign of *Campanula* anywhere near plots. No new tags put out.

Should figure out how to collect seeds soon. Should I collect seeds in all plots or leave some plots for addition experiments?

I looked around at some of the trees and shrubs. Very easy stuff. The pine is lodgepole (the tell is the asymmetric cones). Not quite sure about the other but it's probably Engelmann spruce. The shrub is common juniper.

I also looked at some of the vegetation in the (lodgepole) forest on the road up to the ridge. Below the climate station the understory is bare (trees too tightly packed?) but there are a lot of gaps and openings with a surprising diversity up beyond that (likely before the bog). Lots of flowering *Thermopsis* (looks to be started recently) as well as a lot of lupines, plus some others. Plenty of roses up there too.

I did take 20 minutes today to adjust the height on the pole at plot 67. I think the screw there may be stripped as well. Seems like if there is too much tightening that the screws may fail to adjust. Had this same issue with the one in plot 75 yesterday. Socket wrench should be part of the daily repair kit.

### Jul 11 2021

Put out two more sensors today - one in plot 77 and one in plot 2. The one in plot 2 was with the new case (assembled by me) and what I believe was a SP510 that had never been used before.

I also went in to each of the pre-existing plots (75, 67, 25, 48, 19) and re-located the TEROS sensor. I moved it to ~30cm south of the pole (putting it up against the east boundary of the plot) and up from 7-8 cm to 4-6 cm. For each of these plots/loggers, I collected the data card after making this change. Shoudl be interesting to see the last week's worth of results. One plot I think I made the change (possibly plot 67) in the last minute of the hour so the problem with not having the logger ID recorded may appear again. Ugh.

The sensor at plot 75 was totally upended. Pole out of the ground, bracket dislodged from the pole, inside of container scrambled (batteries out of case, screw terminal plug unplugged from board, battery connector port slightly damaged), rebar out of ground, one tent stake on ground near the base. It looks like an animal but I'm not quite sure. I don't have evidence other than the scrambled innerds of the logger case that anything got inside the case, e.g. doesn't look like the container seal was broken. Two of the tent stakes were in the ground. There also looked to be some damage to one of the cords. I have pics.

So, that sucks. I'd rather not have to deal with that. Also would prefer not to have to spend a lot of time this summer having to set those up again (it took over an hour to repair). But also I don't know what to do in the case of animals other than applying another set of twist ties to safely seal the logger container.

### Jul 12 2021

Only ~60 plants to check on, most of which were not flowering. Thermopsis flowering (in plots at least) is winding down. I'd bet I got about 40 plots with flowering plants in them and 50-60 that didn't have any. 

Annoyingly, there was another animal attack on a sensor. This time the SP510 in plot 67 was totally ravaged. Lots of chewing on the cable (sensor-end) and the sensor was dislodged from the platform. The screw tip was broken off inside the sensor (meaning it can't be used in reseach capacity anymore) and the remainder of the screw and the base piece were found nearby on the ground. I'm not sure yet if the sensor was taking data (or when the attack happened) but beyond a certain time the sensor data will be useless as the SP510 was pointed at the ground. I replaced this one (1645, RIP) with 1875.

After talking briefly with Kris H. he says he thinks both attacks were bears, just being curious. He lent me a game trap that I put around the tree near plot 75 to monitor going forward. He said that some possible ways to avoid this problem in the future are (1) using ammonia (he recommended a rag but I wonder if the cables can be wiped down, although this may affect pollinators) or (2) getting an electric fence. The bears are fast learners so they'll know after getting 1-2 shocks not to mess with them again.

The tuperware at plot 75 was also left dangling. What the heck man...

Speaking of wildlife I got startled by a grouse today between plots 53 and 57. Very annoying!

I missed plant emergence in plot 44 - there were ~3 stems up there that I just never saw. Oh well. Exclude from  first date analysis (although this plot would have been great to have - ugh). I saw a swallowtail butterfly (!) feeding on *Thermopsis* between plots 63 and 57. Very cool.

There is plenty of *Campanula* flowering in the meadow interiors but none in plots. Plot 71 has two purple buds and plot 17 (!) has some green buds. Some bolting plants elsewhere but I'm not sure if they will flower necessarily (will they produce a vertical stem otherwise?). There should be a good down window between the *T* ending and the *C* beginning.

### Jul 13 2021

Meh day. No additional damage to sensors. Cool (smoky) day so not very warm - not good for pollinators.

Need to check collections for bees. I saw a visit by what was possibly the shiny-bottomed bee in plot 25. I captured a similar looking bee in plot 60 though (it was on one of the flags) and it may have actually been a very pale Apis... white markings on face. Ugh whatever.

Started to install a sensor in plot 6 but had to stop halfway due to weather. Resulting station is not level, TEROS is not connected through screw terminal, and the cap is on the SP510, although it is standing erect and the tuperware container is sealed shut.

### Jul 15 2021

*T* is pretty much done in plots - maybe less than 10 total flowers open. Of course in meadow margins, under canopy, and in smaller clearings, it looks to be peaking. But I don't think the plots and data collected will reflect that - ugh.

This does lead to an interesting question - how much aggregated radiation does a meadow/clearing receive as a function of its size/shape? Crass way of putting this question is how large should a meadow be in order to be a meadow... There is a clearing around plot 57 where the interior (sunniest area) looks to be peaking now. The sensor in plot 67 should be able to answer this.

First day of *C* flowering in plots. It appeared in a few plots without me noticing PV - suggests that budding to flowering is fast.

I also harvested *T* fruits. I'll put a protocol on here soon. Briefly, I took plants that had been done for >10 days (this may be too short). I went out and recorded how many remaining fruits they had. If there were only one or two fruits with brown calyxes I took all present. If there were three or more I used a pre-designated list of T/F (Bernoulli variables with $p = 3/4$) variables and, counting from the bottom and going up, harvested fruits according to the sheet. I put all fruits in a brown paper bag labelling the bag with plot, tag, date, and number of fruits inside.

Notably there were a good number of very small fruits that appeared to have no seeds. Aborted? Failure? 

Sensors: 6 was in good shape. Good. I finished this around 10:20 AM. I swapped batteries in the afternoon (around 2). In 19, the screw terminal cable was disconnected from the board, although I don't know if I did this during the initial install or during the repair. 48 and 77's tuperwares were damaged - bitten through? Not quite sure. They will need repairs. 77 I collected the card for but stupidly dropped somewhere - most likely right by the entrance to the aspen stand there where I accidentally dropped the silica grease.

I repaired 67 and 75 - hopefully. 67 had one of the wires not fully secured in the screw terminal. I repaired this. For 75, I did not see a super evident problem. Screw terminal and connection was fine. The port for the D6/D7 screw terminal looked to have been slightly dislodged during the animal attack, but this wouldn't explain why it failed to record data *before* the attack. I tried running with the TEROS unplugged and the flashing red light did indeed work. But when I reconnected it, the board seemed to work... in fact, on the hour, the LED9 which turns on for the TEROS engagement did turn on so perhaps it did take a record? Not sure. 

### Jul 19 and 20 2021

Thermopsis is done. Campanula started last week in plots and is well underway now. Interesting there is a somewhat large density of Campanula in plot 53 - seems to like bare soil.

Sensor in plot 33 was annihilated by a bear. The tuperware (new tacklebox edition) had a gaping hole in the back. There was a single piece of tacklebox by the base of the logger (toppled) so I suspect the bear made the hole then pushed the sensor over before excavating the box's contents. Two of the suspension cables were in place; the third one (in the direction the logger was toppled) had its peg pulled out. Damage to the unit's inner parts appear limited to a dessicant pack chewed through (with contents spilled in to the plot) and the connector for the battery broken. I repaired the damage finishing around 4.

Idiotically I put the data card in my pocket again, went to look for the *other* missing data card, and then promptly lost the plot 33 one. Idiotic. I mostly was searching around plots 77/75 and then went back to the car, but after searching Tuesday couldn't find any evidence of either card. Stupid stupid stupid.

Pollinator observations on Tuesday - seems like the pollinator assemblage for Campanula is more diverse than Thermopsis - at least this year, this time of season. Saw a few bees (not yet identified) and ended by seeing another *B. flavifrons*. Decided that incidental contact (of which there was plenty especially in plot 53) is not worthy of recording except as a note.

###  Jul 22 2021

Long but I think successful day. *T* is done in plots although there is still some in small enclosures and below aspen trees e.g. between plots 38 and 40 or on the N edge of the NW meadow. *C* is underway in many plots including budding in several plots that so far have been unlikely candidates - budding in e.g. plots 3, 23, 42, and flowering in 82. One thing to be on the lookout for here is that the done flowers (purple or white) are harder to identify than I remember - will need special attention. I've been also leaning towards tagging nearby stems as separate plants unless they obviously come from a common rootstock.

Also - the issue of non-continuous flowering for each plant/ramet. Thinking about synchrony... does a plant that starts earlier stick around for the peak of the season? Not sure. Might sorta crush the hypothesis I have. 

I ran in to Julian (and also Chloe) today - Julian told me that his Hobo sensors are spotty and he doesn't have reliable data for this year. Is that common? He isn't quite sure. But the spottiness of environmental data has to be a somewhat-common problem that perhaps there are tools for? The soil moisture and temp I bet could be interpolated (especially with more frequent sampling).

Biggest development of today was that sensor 75 was lightly damaged again today. Two of the stabilizing cables were pulled out but otherwise only minor damage - a little bit of damage to the case and one of the batteries appeared dislodged. Kris H and I looked at the game camera photos and a herd of elk did the damage - in the evening around midnight. Several different elk visited the sensor, gnawing the cables as well as the stabilizing cables. The one male that appeared on camera looked to hit various parts with his antlers, which may have caused the damage to the case. He also rubbed his neck on the pole and case, leaving some visible hairs. There were multiple elk on camera at a given time so likely was a herd. Kris said it's unusual to have elk in the meadows in this time of year (they're typically there in early June) and that their typical pattern is to spend the days up higher in the forest and come down the mountain (towards the meadow) at night to feed. He was surprised to see them there.

So this changes the approach in a couple of ways. First, rather than being a single bear, we're dealing with a lot of animals. One eating a bunch of silica gel probably won't affect any of the others. An electric fence probably won't work unless it's very tall (prohibitively tall). Also according to Kris the elk form "patterns" where they spend a lot of time in the same area so they'll likely return to the same spot and mess with the same sensor. In fact, the cases I've found dangling were likely dislodged from unsecure cable ties by headbutting (or something like that) and not at all from bears (on the subject of bears - tons of bear scat, including two piles within 20 feet of sensor 67, which was untouched). I also think this matters for the placement next spring - the elk will be spending a lot of time in these meadows right around the time the sensors are deployed (late May/early June) leaving them highly susceptible to damage. Who knows how much of the meadows the elk are using - this may explain why sensors 2 and 6 are untouched for now.

I repaired sensor 75 - did not replace the battery because presumably it spent two days being off due to the animal attack. I did replace batteries and sensor cards in, in order, sensors 2, 67, 77, 48, and 25. I fixed the level on sensor 33 without replacing the batteries or card. I set up a sensor in plot 39. I am leaving sensors 6 and 19 out as a test of batteries - will they expire by the 25th? The 6th is in the sun while the 19th should be buffered by the shade (and I suppose also the stream?). 

Need to enter data for phen and sensor modifications.

### Aug 2 2021

Didn't enter last week's data - uneventful. Two sensors (75 and 67) were tipped on Monday and I fixed them. Tuesday after observations I went to the south meadow to harvest some *Thermopsis* fruit for eventual seed studies.

Today: fit in both pollinator observations and plant phenology in the same day. Pollinator observations suck. One observation all day. There are also just so few plants in each plot. Maybe I'm just seeing visitation trail off after the initiation of flowering.

Phenology: lots of plants are being dug out of the ground ("uprooted" in notes column). Pulled out of the ground with rosettes and some root stock showing. Perhaps due to intense grazing? Also some tags being chewed up - especially in plot 71.

Sensor 75 was in good shape today but sensor 67 was toppled again - a single tent stake pulled but the other two intact. Two other sensors (33 and 19) also required re-levelling - in the case of 33 it just looked like a slack cable, maybe due to the tent stake being twisted.

Harvested some fruit from the south meadow today. Did not harvest *Thermopsis* in the interest of time.

### Aug 9 2021

Wrapped in phen and pollinator observations today. 

Lots of flowering in shade today! Very good. Two plants tagged + recorded as PV in shade last week (plots 54 and 63) were uprooted. Tags seem to be attracting predators. Annoying! Plot 42's plants were almost totally eradicated (including an untagged one outside the plot).

Mercifully no sensor damage (aside from S25, totally killed last Thursday). S77 had a tent peg pulled requiring re-levelling but otherwise all sensors appeared to be intact. No sign of elk aside from grazing - perhaps they are done in the meadows for the time being?

Pollinator observations: saw a surprising number of house flies today. Got a video of one (in plot 45) feeding on a *Campanula* anther for a long time. Not sure how much pollen they are moving given their lack of hair, but they are certainly making contact with the important organs! Also saw a *B. sylvica* visit a *C* in plots for the first time today.

### Aug 12 2021

Phenology was short today (less than two hours). Very few (<10) new plants.

Got a late start today (due to evening volunteering down in Nederland). I wanted to put up two more sensors (probably plots 57 and 62) but didn't make it. I put in the rebar and left the pole at plot 57. Remember tent stakes next time!

No visible damage to any sensors. I fixed the sensor in plot 25; was SP510 number 1650 but is now SP510 1642. Also did a card swap on sensor in plot 16.

I talked to a BCOS scientist (Carrie?) about *Thermopsis* seeds. She said that the seeds down on the plains aren't ready until "hard dough" stage, when fruit are starting to split. She had not seen the frangible fruit falling like in our meadows! Wonder why that is - predation? Physiology? But it means the fruit I have collected thus far likely don't have useful seeds. Look for fruit that is brown and starting to crack open!

### Aug 16 2021

Tired and burned out. This sucks.

More uprooting. This sucks too. I wonder if this could be fixed with toothpicks... I set up a game camera by plot 40. I also tried burying a tag in plot 55 (under some pine litter - not soemthing widely replicable) and putting tags down facedown in plot 63. I think for analysis it would be good to just assume the first date of flowering is the first day after these plants were observed like this.

Grazing seems to happen most in the subcanopy - perhaps because they are more conspicuous with less ground coverage? Could try to analyze this. It does hinder reproductive fitness. Source/sink where the source can barely reproduce because the predation risk is so much higher.

Pollinators today - saw two. A small black bee (lasioglossum? maybe? who cares) and a house fly. 

I installed the sensor at plot 57 today. Large rocks meant I had to install the soil moisture on the northern boundary instead of the eastern.

### Aug 20 2021

Phenology continues to wind down - perhaps one extra plant.

Main event today was sensor repair. I uploaded a new script to the arduino boards (August deployment script). I also collected old datacards, replaced batteries, and importantly changed the orientation of the SP510s so that the cables are facing south (towards the sun) to make the calibration more accurate (maybe). The new scripts shouldn't have gaps (the timing issue has hopefully been fixed) and the intervals of the TEROS readings should be much more frequent (15 minutes instead of one hour).

Sensor 75 seems to have had the same data recording character hiccup that sensor 25 had (huh) a couple of weeks ago. Uploading data was not straightforward. Likewise plot 25 somehow had its clock messed with (??). The first digit of the UNIXTIME was off by 1! Huge problem - time wasn't being recorded properly. To salvage the data I'll have to adjust the time columns.

I also installed a sensor at plot 70 (danger zone) - the wires are short so it may fall over easily. 

Sensor 57 was pitched over. I didn't see any evidence of browsing. I think it just fell because one of the tent stakes was turned around and the loop slipped off. This can be fixed by hammering the stakes in until they are flush with the ground.

### Aug 23 2021

Phenology today - close to finished. I believe ~7 plots had open flowers in them. Pollinator observations were meh. Saw several flies and a bumblebee (B. sylvicola) in plot 10 and nothing anywhere else. 

I intended to put up a new sensor today but didn't have enough time. Instead I swapped the card on sensor 16, which appeared to be in good shape.

Sensor 33 was pitched over today. I think it was the same issue as last time - loop slipping off of the tent stake. No signs of browse. Sensors 57 and 70 were standing intact.

Ran in to Nancy today. Among other things she said we should talk about soil moisture - both the probes themselves (TEROS versus what is used on the ridge) and also what to do with measurements. One thing she mentioned is that Sarah Elmendorf has a lot of experience cleaning and imputing/filling these datasets. Very cool! Should talk to her about that in the future.

### Aug 26

Phenology was very short today. There were 1-2 new plants. The overall number of flowering plants is about the same as yesterday (~10).

I installed a sensor in plot 62 today. However, the TEROS LED turned on at the wrong time... I let it run for a few minutes and then collected the card. Turns out, I may not have set the UTC timer on there (ugh). It's running right now but likely will require an offset - or maybe just junking the data (ugh).

I also swapped batteries for sensors in 77 and 57. Looking at the data, they actually did have another ~four day's worth of battery power in them. C'est la vie. Plotting the battery life (see file `/sensors_and_loggers/sandbox/assess_deployment_batteries_aug2021.R` or something like that) it appears that the new script uses batteries at about the same rate as before, and that batteries tend to last for ~12 days. Maybe use a six month sampling interval. I also collected the card for plot 70 to look at its battery usage - and it appears to be working well! 

Looking at the data from the cards - no apparent gaps in measurements. Dope! Also the data looks cool. Very nice! The lack of gaps makes them look so much more compelling. The VWC measurements also look less noisy. There is something strange happening in plot 70 where there's a small increase for an hour or so around 10 am (??). Why?

Thermopsis - following Carrie Cimo's (BCMOS) advice of harvesting fruit when they are starting to split, this could happen soon. Lots of fruit is brown and hardened at this point, but they haven't split open yet. In my meadows (or at least the SW one) there are a good number of fruit, although not necessarily a ton of plants.

I saw three (dusky?) grouse (?) today too around plot 70. Very neat.

### Aug 31 2021

Sensor idiocy (checks):

* 67: toppled, and only 30 seconds (!!!) of records. I think somehow the switch may have been hit after it started. I re-leveled and changed batteries (perhaps not needed). No data collected.
* 75: toppled, with only 3 days of records. Not sure why this one would have stopped. Battery seemed in okay condition so did not switch. I re-leveled (which took an eternity because screws were stripped)
* 70: was recording but somehow, the timer was reset here. I had to reset the RTC. I turned the device off around 3:24.
* 62: was recording. I reset RTC. I turned the device off around 3:41.
* 48: worked. I switched the battery
* 39: worked, but with gaps. Batteries were doing well (around 3.7v). Did not switch battery. 
* 25: had only a few minutes of data. Collected but did not archive data. The switch was off when I arrived. Likely accidentally got turned off. Did not change battery.
* 33: RTC was set to four days prior (?????). I reset RTC. Did not switch batteries. *Note that filenames in archived file are incorrect*. Turned device off around 4:22.
* 6: worked. I switched the battery.
* 2: worked. I switched the battery.
* 16: worked. I did not switch the battery (was around 3.7V)
* 19: worked. I switched the battery.

I did not visit 77 or 57 because they were visited prior.

Pollinator observations (did only six because only three had open flowers) - notes are on the bottom of page 76 (today's plant check datasheet).

### Sep 4 2021

Phenology was relatively quick today. Plot 10's plants got grazed although not fully. On the other hand the plant in plot 74 was totally gone. The plant in plot 70 with a purple bud the time before has flowered now. The plant in plot 39 also initiated flowering today.

Sensors today - not as infurating as last time. 

Sensor 33 was slackened (the cord previously was relying on a branch). I spent some time fixing this.

Sensor 62 was totally obliterated, possibly by the gopher mound appearing there last time. Looking at the records it happened some time in the night the day after I set the timer up - 8/31 or 9/1. I found it around 10m SE of the plot. Strangely, the TEROS sensor (totally out of the ground) was further away from the plot than the pole and SP510, as if the sensor was dragged by the TEROS. But, I did not find any sign of chewing on any of the wires. I did find that the sticker (left over from the Home Depot purchase) was partially peeled off the pole. And, disappointingly, the SP510 was ripped from the platform; I didn't find the remainder of the screw or the bottom part of the platform.

As such I reinstalled this sensor with a new SP510 (1881). I did not put it in plot 62 because the pit the original was left open. Instead I put it in plot 63, which is in some mixed understory. I realized (annoyingly) after that there is a huge snow pole nearly right next to this plot. But, I suppose this will be in any point cloud anyway (and actually does influence the solar radiation... albeit perhaps slightly). I also with remaining time installed a new sensor (originally the one in Brett's yard) in plot 22. This corner of the study are is somewhat overesampled (plots in 16, 19, 22) but I think this portion was important to measure because of the lower density of aspen trees.

* 6: re-leveled at 1:00 (no card swap)
* 33: re-leveled, turned off at 1:14:10 (data good, battery bad) - was behind by 5 minutes so I had to reset the Unixtime; turned on at 1:31:00
* 39: turned off at 1:40:10; last record was at ~2:55 but timer was fine - battery maybe died right before visit!; turned on ~1:50
* 16: turned off at 2:02:40 (is perfect); turned on ~2:05
* 25: turned off at 2:17:40 - **did not** replace batteries (at ~4v) (is perfect); turned on ~2:20
* 57: turned off at 2:30:(00?) (is perfect); turned on 2:37:40
* 70: turned off at 2:46:40 (battery was dead - oops); turned on ~2:50 and releveled at 2:56
* 63: (1881) turned on at 3:36
* 77: turned off 3:46; battery dislodged; did not replace; batteries at 3.8v; turned on 3:50:30
* 75: 4:00:10; battery probably fine (3.7-3.8) but replaced; 

Also I heard elk bugling! In the south meadow. Freaky stuff. Ran in to Scott Taylor as I was leaving; he and several strangers (who were they?) were picking whortleberries (= huckleberries). Cool!

### Sep 9 2021

Two plots (10 and 40) with flowers open today - including a new plant. 1778 in plot 39 also has a bunch of buds. Phenology - a bee visited a plant in plot 10. Crazy.

The two plants with open/shriveling in plot 10 were in the SW corner, shaded somewhat by a tall rock and a stump. This goes to show that there is still microtopography with possible phenological effects that our model will likely miss!

Sensors: annoying. 70 and 75 were pitched over. Fuck these elk. I didn't check for signs of chewing on 70; 75 there was chewing on wires but it may have been old. In retrospect - I also totally forgot to check the batteries (shit). 

I also collected seeds (fruit) today. This was in the western (uphill) open area of the south meadow. Fruit were definitely split open and dropping so these seeds should be ready.

* 70: releveled at 2:25, slightly off but it was a pain in the ass to adjust so whatever
* 75: releveled at 2:37, note that the screws here are stripped
* 77: turned off at 2:40, turned on at 2:45:00
* 48: turned off at 3:09, turned on at 3:11:00
* 25: turned off at 3:19, turned on at 3:21:20 or :40, but may have been turned off when I visited it. I separated batteries in case.
* 6: off at 3:28, on at 3:30 but I didn't see the light come on (possibly a bad sign - check next time)
* 2: off at 3:37, on at 3:38:42
* 16: off at 3:45, on at 3:49:00, I mishandled cards so there are two potential cards in the bag here and one will be empty
* 19: off at 3:55, on at 3:57:21

I collected cards because the laptop wasn't charged enough for use. I learned the next day (9/10) when uploading that the smaller slot on the card reader won't work for several (but not all) of the SD cards. Wow! I also may have dreamed about elk bugling last night.

### Sept 14 2021

Phenology - basically done. Only plants flowering in two plots (39 and 40 - shaded). The one in plot 10 was grazed. There is a pv in plot 23 (ugh but also wow). 

Did not collect seeds today. It was raining in the morning and I got a late start. Hope this is not a problem.

Sensors 6 and 70 were found toppled. Miraculously, 75 and 67 were not.

6: releveled at 3:02 (no battery swap)
70: swapped and releveled at 3:26(~:30), 
75: turned back on at ~3:36(:~30), batteries kept in because they were knocked out before when toppled (were around ~4.5)
67: on at 3:49:50, re-leveled (was slightly off-level) at 3:55:50
63: off, 4:01:10, but the timer was reset (again) (ahhhh)
57: off at 4:24, on at 4:31:00
33: on at 3:45, only swapped middle battery, *revisit*
22: on at ~3:57, I believe I only swapped the two outer vatteries 

Also: aspens starting to turn. The last two weeks there were a handful of branches that had gone yellow; many more today. Still <5% though.

### 23 Sept

Phenology: basically done. Two of the five plants to visit were gone. Plant 1778 had one flower out but it was old (went from 131 to 113 in nine days...). No pollinator observations.

19: off 10:52;30
16: bad record (fixed during import?) on 11:15
22: on 11:28
2: somehow reading column is string? wtf; on 11:40
6: was toppled on 9/14 (took an hour to fix); did not replace batteries; on around 12:43
33: on 12:55
25: on ~1:04
39: on 1:16
48: on 1:28:10
77: on 1:40:40
75: on ~1:49:40
70: re-leveled after toppling; use times after ~2:07, lights still on so assume working well

57, 63, and 67 seemed to be working just fine.

The string issue for plot 2: TEROS gives an extra reading (at the beginning) when the soil temperature goes below zero (great!) This requires processing, but the data is retrievable. It means the soil moisture and the temperature raw readings get concatenated together into the temperature column. Some grep/gsub can fix this (taking advantage of the fact that onl six digits of the TEROS readings are recorded). But this will likely be a recurring issue.

Seems like most *T* plants have dropped seed, but not all. I collected for ~20 minutes in the middle part of the South meadow. May be able to do one more day of collecting. It may be tough to find fruit in the shade.

### Sept 27 2021

Phen: call it over. Nothing flowering (did see some flowers outside plots - probably fewer than five open that I noticed, but still existing). Finished with phenology for the rest of the season.

Sensors:

70: on 11:31
67: below freezing; forgot time
63: only five records; battery meltdown at some point? battery case melted to base; on 12:31:10
57: batteries were dead... fuck; on 12:55
6: on 1:21

Mercifully none of them had fallen over. I went through each and turned stakes that looked like they may slip off.
