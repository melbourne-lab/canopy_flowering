# Field notes

(note: field trip from April 3 2021 surveying snow not included for now)

### May 22 2021

Started putting out plots today. File for doing so (currently in very messy form) is `setup/setup_2021/stratify_sampling.R`.
Output is `setup/setup_2021/plot_init_coords.csv` and `setup/setup_2021/plot_raw_full.png`.
This script output a data frame and plot of 90 coordinates, stratified to include all levels of summer direct radiation.

The script was imperfect (randomness) so my protocol was to go in to the field and try to roughly place these plots using the image and landmarks within it. This was almost surely done imperfectly (i.e. not having exact coordinates). 
There are also some points that were assigned right next to each other. I tried to spread these out by moving one (or occasionally both) to another position, trying to pick a position with a similar amount of direct radiation.

I put down 41 plots today, mostly on the East (lower) side. I recorded (for upload soon) the plot number (not included in the files above), whether or not that plot had snow, and whether the plot was established with four corners (white flags only) or with an orange flag nearby due to snow. I only put down one or two plots (i.e. corners thereof) in snow - did not want to disturb the process of melting. Most of these (esp. those in deep snow) were denoted with an orange flag ("orf") and direction *from the flag* to where the plot should be established.

More detail (esp. on snowdepths) to come.

### May 23 2021

Put out another 41 plots using procedures as outlined above. Total of 82 plots this summer.

Aspen/conifer gallery to the north of the bridge connecting East (I guess now Northeast?) and Northwest meadows had spotty/inconsistent snow. The conifer portion to the North and Northwest of the Northwest meadow was much more consistently (>90%) beneath snow - much of it deep. 

Northwest meadow was pretty dry. Southern (larger) part of the Southwest meadow was dry but the smaller Northern arm of the Southwest meadow was beneath a large snowdrift. Aspens to the west were mostly snowed in but there were a few bare patches where I put plots down.

I saw ~five Thermopsis plants emerging from the ground - two in one plot (I think plot 72/73). Lookng back on photos from last year, there were *a lot* of emerging Thermopsis plants on May 26 and they were much higher/larger (no stem visble on any of this year's yet). Suggests to me that there's probably at least seven-ten days before T starts flowering. ~Two of what I saw (included in the count of five) were purple (on/near the steep open area on the Northern boundary). These may be *Mahonia* (Oregon grape). Otherwise I only saw T in the open part of the SW meadow.

I also over the last two days saw a couple (maybe ~six) of what look like well-defined Campanula rosettes. I wonder if they wjust never senesced last year? They're too small to be from this year. It's also possible it's not Campanula - will need to look more closely at leaves next tme. 

This all means that it's probably too late to get moisture measurements before the T appears. But we should get a solid month before the Campanula appears.

I put out some of the flags right on the edge of snowdrifts. Should be intersting to see how much they melt before the next visit (thinking right now that will be Thursday May 27). 

Got snowed on today. That was neat. Not sure how much stuck but it was I guess too cool to get rain. It was in the 70s in Boulder - this suggests that warm weather in Boulder and even supra-freezing in Ned does not guarantee conditions for massive snowmelt. In general it was half sunny half cloudy thoughout the day - definitely conditions for melting when the sun was out but the afternoon shade looked like it wouldn't cause much melt.

### Jun 3 2021

(Written on June 7)

Today: no aspens leafing out anywhere at site, probably a few buds. Snow mostly gone although still some small drifts remaining below canopy (in pine).

I forgot the black sharpie today so some flags placed today (~10) were unlabelled. I used the flag field on the plot placement file.

Two plots were scrapped today: 12 and 15. 12 I couldn't find and 15 I accidentally pulled the flag and forgot where it was supposed to go. So now there are only 80 plots.

Decided today it's not worth tracking old toothpicks. Too much time, too little reward. As such the number of stems is probably not going to be informative (because new ones will pop up). These could be useful for identifying plants if there are doubles I suppose.

On the drive up, there were leafed-out aspens on hurricane hill but nowhere above that. The highest Thermopsis I think I saw flowering was right before the road widening below Boulder Falls (although coming down a lot of these did look like dandelions or mustards).

### Jun 7 2021

Lower aspens were starting to leaf out and upper ones were not.

Plots with adjacent aspens starting to leaf out: 1, 82, 8, 21, 4, 20, 22, 30, 35, 3, 33, 36, 68, 38
Plots with adjacent aspens not leafing out: 28, 9, 43, 39, 29, 31, 56, 64, 63, 81, 78, 76 77

Decided today it's too hard to toothpick Campanula. Both because it's starting now and it would be a lot of added work plus also because they're kinda hard to identify.

There was Thermopsis flowering on the part of Peak to Peak with the viewpoint and maybe even one flowering on the road by the trailhead. But there were none flowering in the meadows (obviously) and no yellow visible so probably another week until they start. Nothing else flowering in meadows except for one Mertensia and whatever that tiny yellow plant was.

All plots have been placed as of today. Work day today was 5.5 hours. Hopefully shorter going forward.

### Jun 10 + Jun 14 2021

Jun 10 took ~4.5 hours. Ending was slightly tight due to approaching flight. 71, 73, 74 may have been rushed due to being at the end and also being watched (?) by an animal (assume deer). 

Nearly all aspens were out save for those above plots 64 (and possibly 63).

First flowering Thermopsis seen - large patches on the eastern edge of the NE meadow (where I recall some of the earliest ones being in 2020) as well as possibly the E edge of the NW meadow. Did see some pollination occurring on one of these few plants in the NW meadow and got a picture.

Nervous that I am missing a good number of merging T plants. Probably an unavoidable problem given constraints. I marked these when recording with an asterisk, and noted them when entering data (jun 14) as something like "possibly prev. missed". Should go through at some point and make changes.

Relatedly there were some data entry issues from June 7.

Jun 14 took about five hours. Aspens are effectively done leafing out and canopy is full. Still seeing plenty of T coming out of the ground. Did see a handful of missed plants.

Thankfully no flowering thus far within plots. I marked a few plants that had yellow visible. I think it is unlikely that these or any others flower by this upcoming Thursday. Regardless no pollinator observations tomorrow (Tues Jun 15).

### Jun 17 2021

Flowering today in a few plots - some of the low 70s (71 and 73 I think) as well as 62 and 8, perhaps others. 8 seems to have advanced phenology for some reason. Not very many new plants although some plots (esp. 1 and 2) seemed to have a lot. No plants in most of the pine plots (50s).

I think my plots will be slightly slower than the modal plots. A lot of flowering is happening in the upper meadows (especially on the part just west of the steep part in the S one) but it's behind in plots. There were very few flowering plants in the large central aspen stand (<10 that I saw) and I didn't notice any with wings spread in any of the other aspen stands aside from plot 8.

Due to scarcity of tags (or at least perceived scarcity) I did not tag YV plants in plots higher than 40. I did note these on the data sheet although without tags - just with toothpicks. I tagged YV plants in lower numbered (downhill) plots. I was never planning on using YV in analysis anyway.

I started up top today and ended down below - really liked this order as it meant the tedious plots were done early in the day. Ending in the aspen stands (4, 20-22) was also nice.

Saw Bombus nevadensis pollinating around plot 6. Also saw another Bombus although it was moving too quickly to detect. No other pollinators observed on Thermopsis. Saw a good number (definitely including small bees, possibly including bumblebees) on Mertensia though.

### Jun 21 2021

Solstice today! Wanted to put out first sensors today but could not - code from a test deployment in Brett's yard was buggy. Ugh.

Today was foggy - low cloud rolling throughout the meadow throughout the entirety of my day. Dew drops on everything, very wet (including flowers). Temperatures in the 40s (47F when I left). No pollinators observed of course.

Moisture made some slight confusion with the toothpicks - it's possible that orange faded to white. But I am confident in the data I collected. I ran a little short on tags again (put out a lot today) so some of the plots had only toothpicks with no tags, but there were few of these.

Pollinator observations starting tomorrow - have 13 plots with plants in them. Will use 12 of them - these 12 will be selected in the datasheet generation script. Protocol will be uploaded soon but briefly - 12 plots, 15 minutes spent watching each for a total of 180 minutes.

### Jun 22 2021

A lot less pollination than I expected. Seems like much less than last year (speculative/observational). Possibly due to cold weather yesterday? But alternatively you may expect there to be more pollination after a bad day...

Need a tight seal on net when catching. Lost a small bee today.

Truly not very many *Bombus* species today. Those I did see were often large - could have been *nevadensis* but some looked to have red (*mixtus* or *appositus*). Were they queens? Are entire colonies active yet?

Flies (incl. syrphs) seemed to prefer the yellow celery type plant and the *Microsteris*-looking plant. Some fed on *Taraxacum*. Saw a *Bombus* and another bee on *Taraxacum*. Bees also like *Mertensia*. Rare switching occuring with a lep (white with orange tipped wings) going *Microsteris* to *Mertensia* (maybe 5-10m around plot 79).

Looks like there's a nest for some bee in the basal sage about 1m N of plot 59.

#### Jun 25

Beautiful day! Not much to observe other than that pollination still appears rare (only saw *B. nevadensis* and maybe a syrph) and that I put in too little effort in checking for new emerging plants. Was wet in the morning.

Lots of *Dodecatheon*, still some *Mertensia* and a few wallflowers. Shaded sunflower (*Arnica*?) is in full swing.

It would be cool to think about movement, specifically encroachment. *T* pops growing/shrinking with encroachment. Some seed broadcasting/addition in different habitat types would be cool and useful. There is some *T* in pine around plot 40 but that's most/all of what I have seen in the interior-ish Northern pine.

Right before leaving I did see a *Bombus* fly in to (but not really stop in) aspens towards plot 4. Very neat!

### Jun 28 2021

Rainy morning - rained when I arrived and cleared up around 8:45. Think that early mornings that would otherwise would be clear will have cloud cover until the sun zaps the clouds away. In any event, no pollinator action until around 11am despite the sky clearing hours before.

Very wet, little progress. Close to no new tags. Seems like most plants had the same number of flowers as before, although there were many exceptions. Seems like there was status advancement (a few YV plants flowering) for those plants already budding but few to no plants starting to bud. Thinking it would be cool to look at cumulative temperature (some proxy for GDD) in relation to emergence of flowers although the microclimate variation (shade) would complicate that considerably, as would the time dependence (early vs. late season).

Hardly checked for new TPs today because of time crunch. There were some previously missed in 74. Ugh - consider ignoring that plot in Tp analysis. Relatedly, had a couple more no-tp plants bud/flower today. Thinking that in the MS these can be noted by saying they were mostly on the boundary and there were questions about being in or not.

### Jun 29 2021

Weather is weird. Didn't start until around 9 but the weather was great, but then it cooled off around 11. This is during the very cool and wet week - temperatures around the 40s. It will be good to use the time of observation as an intercept (note: check that this exists).

Skipped the final plot (9) due to threatening weather. It would have been another observation at 40 degrees showing no observations - would have helped standard error but perhaps not much else.

Grant joined today to check on signs of animal use. Tons of moose signage. Large-ish vertical-running scars on aspens that expose lower layers of bark - caused by teeth (!). There were a few of these that looked very fresh (definitely from this season) in the aspen stand housing 4 and 20-22. There were also some smaller aspen trees toppled, either by pushing them over or by pulling them down while browsing on top layers. There are a few of these that look fresh (bark isn't dried yet) in the same aspen stand. Is this the only area with these signs of browse? This does make me nervous about sensors.

### Jul 1 2021

Emerging plant (toothpick) hunting has been poor recently. Missing lots seen every day. I think there will be too much bias to tell mean emergence dates at each plot. It will still be possible to get first days of emergence, though. I do need to do surveys at the end to get a total toothpick count.

Love the Dodecatheons! Also the columbines are out and doing very well right now - sticking mostly to shaded areas.

Speaking of plants that do well in the shade - the Arnicas (?) look like a shade-adapted species that could be used in a forest movement study. Or perhaps for edge effects? Is this the same species (or one of the species) that Young was studying in the 80s in the Medicine Bow range?

Weather continues to be weird. Was clear when I started around 8 but I got rained on around 10:30 while working on plot 74. Waited in the car for an hour before finishing.

I did a pollinator observation in the plot I missed last time (plot 9). Started at 1:24 pm. Was warm-ish when (or rather right before) I started but it quickly clouded over. Of course, no pollinators observed (ugh). Made me wonder about what the best way to assign a temperature to each observation period would be - the beginning? Averaged over the time window?

I did see a Bombus (one of the small ones - mixtus? didn't get a great look) look at but skip *Thermopsis* but did land on a wallflower in plot 59.

Lots more flowers from Monday to today than there were from last Friday to Monday. Must have been a few good warm-ish days. Makes me wonder about springing and path dependence...

### Jul 3 2021

Wow very much a dogshit day. Tried to put out sensors today. The first and worst was plot 6 - tried both corners and eventually had something off-level that collapsed when trying to fix. In retrospect I think it was because the hose clamp was too high, which let the pole move freely from the bottom and tip over easily. The hose clamp looks like it may be done. I took this unit out of the ground (partially assembled). It's possible that the un-filed bottom damaged the cable for the sensor. Hmm...

Otherwise I successfully installed sensors in plots 19, 25, and 48.

### Jul 5 2021

Typical flowering observations took about three hours. Fewer than ten new tags put out.There were a lot more flowers that finished than in the previous two visits - possibly due to nice weather over the weekend. I think we may be past *Thermopsis* peak. However I am noticing a lot of *Campanula* looking like it will flower in full. Interestingly, I saw these most in the pine forest.

Think it's time to take "done" flowers off the *Thermopsis* sheet. Should also edit the sheet to call any plants with *decreasing* done flowers done (rather than requiring them to be the same) as well as collected tags (I did collect two).

I took out the card for sensor 48 today. For equipment, I brought the cable cutters and extra cards. However, I did not bring  cable ties. If ever doing card and battery swapping while sampling, I'll need to bring these. Otherwise the logger will be dangling. I collected the card by simply slipping a sheet of paper with the plot and SP510 number inside the plastic case for the card. The logger was left dangling from around 11 to 1 pm.

I also tried putting out more sensors today but got rained out. Radar for that area is useless! 

### Jul 7 2021

Pollinator observation day + sensor placement.

Thought at first the pollinator observation was a bust. Maybe it still is? Went today (Wed) instead of yesterday because forecast yesterday looked very bad (although according to Warren there was no rain until the afternoon). Consequently some of the plots selected were done - I had to supplement with other nearby plots (think I swapped 57 in for 59 and 74 in for 73). I didn't see anything early in the day, but I did see stuff later - three *Bombus nevadensis* visits. Saw *B. nevadensis* on some lupines too. Another species (smaller, likely *Bombus flavifrons*) was visiting Mertensia in the lower meadows but was going hog wild in a thick patch of *Thermopsis* by plot 70 - probably saw at least six. Otherwise I saw an orange lep and a house fly but not much else. I did see that missed bee from the first day at some point - seems to be a common pollinator.

It'll be kinda tough to figure out what to use as a predictor in the analysis. Sky view? Hmm...

I put out two more sensors today - plots 67 and 75. Would have put out 77 but I instead looked at the rooting depth of some plots in the adjacent (large south) meadow. Max depth I saw for tissue in either species (looking at 2-3 plants) was maybe only 4cm, as shallow as 3cm. I was looking mostly at rhizomes/runners. I did see some bud-like organ but it was maybe only at 4cm. I think it would be good to place the TEROS probes closer to around 4-5 cm depth instead of 7-8cm. Looking at some of the data from plot 48 (jul 3 - jul 5), at a depth of 7-8 we still see diurnal curves in soil temperature. Hmm..

Also, because I don't think I tightened a bolt enough, the platform in 67 will need to be adjusted upward (which may require some other adjustments... ugh). The level in 67 is finnicky as well - would be good to go in with glue.

OH also - Campanula is up. Saw some open south of plots 37 and 27 (approximate locations of last year's plots 7 and 71 or 72). Also saw some that were going to open soon elsewhere. No buds visible in plots though.

### Jul 8 2021

Standard phenology day. No sign of *Campanula* anywhere near plots. No new tags put out.

Should figure out how to collect seeds soon. Should I collect seeds in all plots or leave some plots for addition experiments?

I looked around at some of the trees and shrubs. Very easy stuff. The pine is lodgepole (the tell is the asymmetric cones). Not quite sure about the other but it's probably Engelmann spruce. The shrub is common juniper.

I also looked at some of the vegetation in the (lodgepole) forest on the road up to the ridge. Below the climate station the understory is bare (trees too tightly packed?) but there are a lot of gaps and openings with a surprising diversity up beyond that (likely before the bog). Lots of flowering *Thermopsis* (looks to be started recently) as well as a lot of lupines, plus some others. Plenty of roses up there too.

I did take 20 minutes today to adjust the height on the pole at plot 67. I think the screw there may be stripped as well. Seems like if there is too much tightening that the screws may fail to adjust. Had this same issue with the one in plot 75 yesterday. Socket wrench should be part of the daily repair kit.
