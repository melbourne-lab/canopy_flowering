# Field notes

(note: field trip from April 3 2021 surveying snow not included for now)

### May 22 2021

Started putting out plots today. File for doing so (currently in very messy form) is `setup/setup_2021/stratify_sampling.R`.
Output is `setup/setup_2021/plot_init_coords.csv` and `setup/setup_2021/plot_raw_full.png`.
This script output a data frame and plot of 90 coordinates, stratified to include all levels of summer direct radiation.

The script was imperfect (randomness) so my protocol was to go in to the field and try to roughly place these plots using the image and landmarks within it. This was almost surely done imperfectly (i.e. not having exact coordinates). 
There are also some points that were assigned right next to each other. I tried to spread these out by moving one (or occasionally both) to another position, trying to pick a position with a similar amount of direct radiation.

I put down 41 plots today, mostly on the East (lower) side. I recorded (for upload soon) the plot number (not included in the files above), whether or not that plot had snow, and whether the plot was established with four corners (white flags only) or with an orange flag nearby due to snow. I only put down one or two plots (i.e. corners thereof) in snow - did not want to disturb the process of melting. Most of these (esp. those in deep snow) were denoted with an orange flag ("orf") and direction *from the flag* to where the plot should be established.

More detail (esp. on snowdepths) to come.
