# Field notes (2023 field season)

### May 13

Ran into Haley (? - Scott's post doc) setting up bird boxes. They have hundreds up there? Neat.

Checked on data loggers and general site condition today. Overcast and cool weather.

I only looked at five or six dataloggers - all but two were standing. 
Might be able to simply turn these back on?

Meadow interiors were snow free with the exception of a couple of small snowdrifts.
Understory was snowier but still had ~50% bare ground.

Saw a grouse! No large mammals though.

### May 16

Went up today with Grant.

Checked on the following sensors:

06R: had fallen over but otherwise in good shape. Turned on.
130: fallen over. Hole in case - water inside. Propped up but not turned on. Might be unsalvageable.
135: standing. Turned back on.
164: fallen over. Did not prop up.
167: standing. Turned back on (red light at ~11:50 - timer off?)
153: standing. Turned back on (~12:10)
140: standing. Turned back on (~12:35)
124: standing. Did not turn on. 
115: standing. Turned back on (~1:03)
102: standing. Did not turn on.

There was another sensor in the woods - I forget the plot number, maybe 137?
I couldn't see it but didn't look very hard. Likely toppled.

I also collected data from the old sensors. Very cool!

Also shot coordinates with the GPS. I set up the base station between plots 6 and 7.
I was able to shoot 33 points - pretty painless. Unfortunately coords are in lat/long.
Can't confirm their accuracy yet but on a map they look good.
Job name on emlid app: MRS Test 1

Unfortunately the pink flags are both faded and often detached from the pole. Grr...
Some plots are still likely buried under snow, e.g., likely plot 4, 21, 106?, others

I uploaded the raw file to the `data/spatial` folder.
I also have a modified file for edits here.

Should go up again soonish when snow situation is better!
