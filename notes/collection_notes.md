# Data collection notes and protocol

### Infloresences

(June 4)

Field work on June 2 made it obvious that a distinction should be made between Thermopsis infloresences presenting pollen and those presenting wings. It seems unlikely to me that an infloresence can be effectively pollinated before its wings spread, but I checked, and they *do* present pollen before spreading.

I think it's worth having two separate columns - one for number of infl. presenting pollen, nd one with number of infl. with fruit spread. It's better to have this data than not.

### Twist tied infloresences

(June 4)

Field work on June 2 got me thinking about how to track tied infloresences. Similar to Echinacea project data collection, we should be tracking the progress of each of these floresences moving through various statuses. This will give us an idea how long an individual flower is open.

### Flowers - open, producing pollen, spreading

(June 8)

Decided on June 5 not to collect data on plants producing pollen. Assessing whether or not plants are producing pollen requires pinching open the petals - this may damage the flowers or induce a response. It's better to assume that a plant won't be visited unless the wings are spread (so far, in a small number of observations, this pattern has been true).

So, I am counting only plants with "wings spread", i.e., the two top petals being open to the side. I only count flowers where *both* petals are open.

Starting to see some cases where plants are done flowering. It appears that plants turn brown at the bottom petals and/or shrivel up, then the seedpod emerges. I have pictures. I will monitor these going forward. Did have one flower recorded as "done" today.

### Helping with non-flowering plots

(June 14)

Basically, the plot design means I am estimating the first date of flowering for each plot. But, some plots are wasted because there are no plants flowering in them. This issue perhaps can be remedied by taking the closest plant to the plot. To avoid picking up plants in a different light environment, do this only within a small distance of the plot; I chose the distance from the bottom of the clipboard to the bottom of the hole for the handle (not sure what this is; I didn't have a ruler). If there are multiple plants within this distance, take only the closest. Keep checking this throughout the season to avoid phenological bias (i.e., avoid catching only early plants here).

I recorded a couple of these plants, including tagging, on June 14. They are noted as "Outside, XX" in comments with "XX" the flag they are closest to (NE, NW, SE, SW).

### Counting flowers and terminology

(June 14)

Right now the data is not well equipped for counting the overall number of flowers a plant produces (ill-suited for calculating fitness proxies). It is perhaps worth adding a "peduncles" column and counting at some point the number of peduncles. Doing this every time would be annoying, though, and wouldn't work with plants still budding. Think about how to do this well. It should be easier with Campanula.

A problem with waiting too long to count these, though, is that peduncles are short and likely dry out at some point. They can be broken off. I did this to one seeding flower today by accident.

On this subject, what I am counting as "racemes" is probably poor terminology. I'm counting stems. Do racemes have to have an infloresence atop them? Look into this. Is it worth counting infloresences?
