# Data collection notes and protocol

### Infloresences

(June 4)

Field work on June 2 made it obvious that a distinction should be made between Thermopsis infloresences presenting pollen and those presenting wings. It seems unlikely to me that an infloresence can be effectively pollinated before its wings spread, but I checked, and they *do* present pollen before spreading.

I think it's worth having two separate columns - one for number of infl. presenting pollen, nd one with number of infl. with fruit spread. It's better to have this data than not.

### Twist tied infloresences

(June 4)

Field work on June 2 got me thinking about how to track tied infloresences. Similar to Echinacea project data collection, we should be tracking the progress of each of these floresences moving through various statuses. This will give us an idea how long an individual flower is open.

### Flowers - open, producing pollen, spreading

(June 8)

Decided on June 5 not to collect data on plants producing pollen. Assessing whether or not plants are producing pollen requires pinching open the petals - this may damage the flowers or induce a response. It's better to assume that a plant won't be visited unless the wings are spread (so far, in a small number of observations, this pattern has been true).

So, I am counting only plants with "wings spread", i.e., the two top petals being open to the side. I only count flowers where *both* petals are open.

Starting to see some cases where plants are done flowering. It appears that plants turn brown at the bottom petals and/or shrivel up, then the seedpod emerges. I have pictures. I will monitor these going forward. Did have one flower recorded as "done" today.
