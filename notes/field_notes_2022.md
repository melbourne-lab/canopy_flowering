# Field notes (2022 field season)

### May 31

I had gone out and checked conditions at the site twice earlier this month.

May 26: after the large snow event (~May 21/22) nearly all the site was beneath snow.
Meadow interiors had ~2 inches. A handful of trees had bare patches. 
Also a couple of bare areas on the slope in the SW meadow.
Blue flags indicate bare areas.

May 9: very little snow left at the site. Flags mostly noting remaining snowbanks.

I tried setting up plots today but got snowed out.

Arriving today, there was <5% of original snowcover on ground. Definitely T that was up, including in aspens. No flowers.

I put out plots 1 - 31; these were nearly all plots east of the middle aspen stand (including).
I stayed pretty faithful to the locations and estimation desciles
(see `setup/setup_2022/plot_stratify_sampling.R` and related files).

Snow rendered the paper map unusable so I stopped. Snow was sticking when I left.

Will return soon.

### Jun 2

Went up today to finish establishing plots. Snow was mostly gone - meadow interiors were zapped, aspen zapped, pine ~75% covered.

In total, I put out 70 plots as planned. Plot locations marked with pink flags (super visible!). 
I ended up not using any other of the snow markings. These have been mostly collected.

I went through each plot at the end of the end of the day and recorded snow.
The following plots had >50% snow still on them:
19, 34, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 48, 57, 59, 65
The following plots are snow free and have *not* been established yet (ran out of time):
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 33, 52, 55, 60, 61, 63, 64, 68, 69, 70

Aspens have not leaved out yet. Buds visible but still very early.
Aspens have started leafing out on P2P though.
I drove through Ned on the way back and the roadside T on the entrance to town looks done (!).

### Jun 4

Late start today, only focused on installing sensors. Installed two: one at 33, one at 67.

I did not pay special attention to the direction the mount plates needed to be facing. I put SP510 cables facing north.
I misplaced my ruler so depths were approximate but serviceable (used a thumb-length as a substitute for an inch).

I also placed flags at some of the SW plots including 33, 52, 54, 63, 64, 68, 69, 70.

### Jun 6

I got to the station today and unfortunately realized I forgot to check which sensors to install.
Trying on the station computer generated a different list than my old one (maybe because their version is from 2016?!)

I installed sensors at 64 (from old list), 2, and 15. Next up should be 47. Shovel is by plot 15.

A low stand of aspens had leafed out but none others. I'm pretty sure there were no plots under the aspens leafing out (they're a few meters S of plot 2-4).
Plot 2 had not leafed out yet.

I got rained out before I could do much else. Did not establish any plots. Did not do a card swap on June 4th's sensors.

I was able to swap one of the mount plates on one of the poles without a level. 
While I can replace some (four) of these, I figured that I can also replace them with unused mount plates.

There were some T plants with yellow buds visible in the SW meadow. Still at least two days from flowering though. None in plots (that I saw).

### Jun 9

I set up a sensor at plot 125. My own lack of preparedness meant this is the only one I was able to put up today. I lost my ruler again.

I was also able to put up the remainder of the plots. There were a couple of small patches of snow, with none in plots.

Flowering: I saw <10 plants flowering site wide. The amazing thing is that two of them were in plot 117!
There were a few YV plants but nto as many as I expected. Some in 169. Some in areas that seemed first to snow off - steep part of the SW meadow and the N side of the NW meadow. Very few open flowers.

I talked with Amy W. (!) today about pollen.
She said with EP she uses toothpicks. Could I do this?
She also recommended using an electric toothbrush (brush removed) for buzzing pollen off.
She suspects that organzo bags trap moisture.
She stores pollen in a cooler with an ice pack, ut likely doesn't last very long.
Dust study sounds cool!

I swapped cards on sensors 133 and 167 today (haven't read them in yet).
