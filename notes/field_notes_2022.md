# Field notes (2022 field season)

### May 31

I had gone out and checked conditions at the site twice earlier this month.

May 26: after the large snow event (~May 21/22) nearly all the site was beneath snow.
Meadow interiors had ~2 inches. A handful of trees had bare patches. 
Also a couple of bare areas on the slope in the SW meadow.
Blue flags indicate bare areas.

May 9: very little snow left at the site. Flags mostly noting remaining snowbanks.

I tried setting up plots today but got snowed out.

Arriving today, there was <5% of original snowcover on ground. Definitely T that was up, including in aspens. No flowers.

I put out plots 1 - 31; these were nearly all plots east of the middle aspen stand (including).
I stayed pretty faithful to the locations and estimation desciles
(see `setup/setup_2022/plot_stratify_sampling.R` and related files).

Snow rendered the paper map unusable so I stopped. Snow was sticking when I left.

Will return soon.
