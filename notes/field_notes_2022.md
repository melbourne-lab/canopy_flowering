# Field notes (2022 field season)

### May 31

I had gone out and checked conditions at the site twice earlier this month.

May 26: after the large snow event (~May 21/22) nearly all the site was beneath snow.
Meadow interiors had ~2 inches. A handful of trees had bare patches. 
Also a couple of bare areas on the slope in the SW meadow.
Blue flags indicate bare areas.

May 9: very little snow left at the site. Flags mostly noting remaining snowbanks.

I tried setting up plots today but got snowed out.

Arriving today, there was <5% of original snowcover on ground. Definitely T that was up, including in aspens. No flowers.

I put out plots 1 - 31; these were nearly all plots east of the middle aspen stand (including).
I stayed pretty faithful to the locations and estimation desciles
(see `setup/setup_2022/plot_stratify_sampling.R` and related files).

Snow rendered the paper map unusable so I stopped. Snow was sticking when I left.

Will return soon.

### Jun 2

Went up today to finish establishing plots. Snow was mostly gone - meadow interiors were zapped, aspen zapped, pine ~75% covered.

In total, I put out 70 plots as planned. Plot locations marked with pink flags (super visible!). 
I ended up not using any other of the snow markings. These have been mostly collected.

I went through each plot at the end of the end of the day and recorded snow.
The following plots had >50% snow still on them:
19, 34, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 48, 57, 59, 65
The following plots are snow free and have *not* been established yet (ran out of time):
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 33, 52, 55, 60, 61, 63, 64, 68, 69, 70

Aspens have not leaved out yet. Buds visible but still very early.
Aspens have started leafing out on P2P though.
I drove through Ned on the way back and the roadside T on the entrance to town looks done (!).
