### Inouye, 2001. Response surface experimental designs for investigating interspecific competition. Ecology.

Context here is that two-species competition experiments typically use additive or substitution designs, which have been widely critiqued. This paper highlights why response designs are better.

##### Review of designs

Objective of the experiment are crucial to evaluate. 

In competition experiments, three possible objectives: (1) Measure effects of competitor Y on focal species X without interest in effects of X on Y. (2) Distinguish between intraspecific and interspecific competition. (3) Estimate parameters for a model given that its functional form has been chosen.

**Substitution design** with two species holds overall number/density of individuals constant while varying ratios of species. **Additive design** holds one species density constant, varies density of the competitor. Both of these designs trace a line in the X,Y plane (substitution is a x+y=1, additive is a x = 1).

Substitution designs confound variation in intraspecific and interspecfic density, giving results only to one density and giving inference only at an arbitrarily chosen single-species density (on boundaries). Additive designs give insight into effects on focal species across overall density range, but don't give insight into intraspecific competition on focal.

**Response surface designs** sample a grid over X,Y space. This does not necessarily require factorial designs; any design where treatments do not fall on a line are response surface. This allows the experimenter to distinguish between inter- and intraspecific competition. An advantage of this is that this allows estimation of model parameters in mechanistic (e.g., population dynamic) models. More levels are good for cases of non-linearity in response (competition or density dependence in this case) on either axis.
