# Initial sensor notes June 2020

### June 19 2020 Meeting Notes

Hobo: measure temperature and solar radiation
UA002-08 (one is 8K, one is 64K)
4K can store 3.5K combined temperature and light
64K can store ~28K combined temperature and light

There are nearby solar radiation sensors, so these could be good for getting global patterns (above-canopy). The permanent sensors can tell us about the clouding.

These sensors would be used to see microhabitat (trees, maybe some topography). 

Temperature - what temperature? What temperature is relevant?
- Ambient temperature: difficult to measure, not incredibly relevant
- The plant temperature is more likely determined by solar radiation
- Soil temperature also important somehow

Think it's well known that soil moisture is a trigger, but would be more common these days due to better tchnology.

We could buy maybe 20 of these...
Can we deploy these and interpolate?
- Calibrate the model w/ in situ sensors

Home-made
https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13128
^^ order equipment for this now, try making 2-3, w/ eye for making more later

For making an Elk solar radiation model: could cadge calibration data from the work further up
There are associated solar radiation sensors for these, but no loggers. Could purchase some loggers now to link up with those; these could be used for purchasing 

Look at soil moisture sensors. See if you can purchase some pre-made ones which can be plugged into a data logger for cheap. Take a look at the UAV biodiversity repo.

Having a pro. moisture probe by hand is a good idea. You can use it to sample places where the logger is not, giving some idea of spatial variance and allowing spatial variation.

soil moisture sensors

brett making a dir in UAV-b... folder on google drive (has moisture in dir name)

three types of sensors
- TDR: time domain reflectometry
	- standard, but typically expensive
	- technology pushing prices down... but still likely v expensive (thousands)
- Electrical resistance approaches
	- (these are the cheap ones)
	- loose correlation between what these measure and moisture
	- "pretty useless" compared to a research grade sensor
- Capacitance
	- newer, cheaper (~$100), probably more desirable
	- Soil water potential vs. soil water content
		- potential: available for plant
		- content: what is there
		- Sensors are expensive

Potential sensors are simpler
	- porous medium
	- like gypsum blocks

erstwhile Decagon devices, now Meter (?) Group
	- TEROS range
		- have both potential and content
	- Email them... see what is needed
	- ask about how much, but probably expensive
	- Brett will ask them for quotes
	- works w/ 3.5-5 V (this is good)

Truebner
	- SMT/SNT 100 model could be good
	- capacitance sensor
	- SN will ask for quote

SpecMeters
	- WaterScout SM100 is ~100

DFRobot
	- capacitance sensor, cheaper

Cheap vs. expensive: cheaper ones likely require more calibration

Handhelds: are these accurate at all...?
	- TDR here is likely the best possible (Acclima)
	- do we have anything like this in the department?
	- SN will ask for a quote on the TDR-315H and reader kit

Soliciting a quote:
	- say it's a research project at CU
	- quick description of project
	- ask if product is appropriate
	- ask for price (university pricing)

Re: Mayflies
	- Invest in good sensors now (these will be more expensive)
	- simply wait on mayflies
