# Field notes

### May 30 2020

Established 36 plots today in the three complexes: 

- 1 - 12 in the plot closest to the MRS campus

- 21 - 33 in the northwest corner meadow

- 41 - 51 in the southwest meadow

Was going to lay out a couple more in the shade in the southwest but weather got bad. The final plots I put out were in the sun. Plots 1-6, 22, 23-28, and 47-51 were placed in spots designated on a map on May 29. The remainders were placed strategically to maximize the span of light availability.

There were plants flowering in the NW complex, but otherwise, no signs of flowering. No flowering in plots. A couple of plants I tagged because the yellow of the infloresences was startig to emerge from the buds. Aspens were probably 1/3 of the way leafed out.

### Jun 2 2020

Checked on old plots today. Established plots 13-20, 34, 52-53 in complexes consistent with the numbering scheme. Total number of plots is now 47. I visited all prior plots.

I had been tagging all plants with buds. However, I ran out of tags by plot 49. Old tags stayed in place, which is good!

Saw one flowering plant in plot 46 and two flowering in plot 48.

Aspens were probably 75% of the way leafed out today. Less leafing in the very large stand in the middle of the study area.

Saw two large mammals. Maybe moose? My mind's eye remembers them as camels... they looked kinda large for deer but they moved somewhat similar to deer.

##### Things to fix

It's a good idea to differentiate between plants presenting pollen with those spreading fruit. Make two columns in the data sheet.

How to follow twist-tied plants? Probably should do different form for these.

Make plots in aspen shade? Can do it around plot 42.

### Jun 5 2020

Have flowering in plots in two of the three complexes: the SW complex, and one plot (14 - a plot from June 2) in the E complex. There are many flowers in the NW complex, but none are in plots.

I'm a little bit nervous about the early tagging I was doing. The first two days I was out, I tagged everything that was budding. But nearly all of those tagged plants are in dire shape right now, with buds that have barely progressed. Meanwhile, the plants that were not pre-emptively tagged (in plots 46 - 51) look good. Now, there is a spatial confounder here, but this is consistent with tagging (too soon) doing damage to plants. Checking budding records here could be helpful.

The eastern part of the aspen stand (downhill, by east meadow) has a lot of plants bolting. It would be good to monitor these with plots. There are also some somewhat clear areas in here. There are also some small clearings in the pines uphill from the cabins (downhill from Julian's meadows). There is some sparse Thermopsis in here.

Decided today not to count plants presenting pollen. I don't want to damage flowers by squeezing open petals to check for pollen. Now, I will only count flowers with both wing spread.

Saw some bumblebees on *Thermopsis* today. I'm recording when visits happen to focal plants in notes (not really useful for analysis though).

### Jun 8 2020

Saw some flowers (not in plots) which were finished. Looks like flowers go through the following phases: browning, shrivelling, then seeding. In the future *count shrivelling flowers as done*. I have pictures of these.

There were some pre-tagged plants with yellow visible today, but not very  many. Still lots of plants with buds that looked awful. Outside of both plots 25 and 26, there were plants (untagged because they were outside of the plot) which looked great with yellow visible as well. Further supports the hypothesis. On the other hand, there are still plenty of plants (outside plots) with bad looking buds. Is it worth doing test plots to examine this?

The aspen stand has a lot of *Thermopsis* which hasn't flowered yet. There is some on the west side (uphill) of the stand. The interior of this has a lot of Helianthus (or Helianthella - not sure which) some of which is starting to flower (I have a picture).

I am wondering if there are plants that bold but do not flower. Botany notes on this species are rare so I didn't see if they flower every year. Most of the shaded plots have  small (1-4) number of plants coming out right now, but if they don't all flower, the experiment is kinda shot. I could at the end of the season do a count within each plot, recording the number of flowering plants (and/or probability of flowering). 

### Jun 11 2020

East (downhill) meadow still far behind the other two meadows. Upper open areas of the SE meadow are very active; the very steep part is not as active. NE meadow has some parts which are very active.

Saw a Lepidopteran of some sort (got a pic) on a Thermopsis today; not sure if pollinating or just hanging out. Also very importantly saw a HUMMINGBIRD pollinating Thermopsis in the SW meadow. It hit four or five plants up and down the meadow; long distance pollen movement! Also saw an small black bee.

Thoughts about counting "done" plants - count plants as done when they have shrinkage and/or loss of color *and* shrinking/shrivelling banners. I.e., if both banners are still out, count the flower as "spread".

Put out new shaded plots today in the aspen stand. These are marked 61 - 69 with orange flags (I am out of white flags right now). Locations here were chosen somewhat haphazardly. No flowering yet; there were two plants with yellow visble.

I also laid out the following tags to look at the effects of tagging on development

* 1243 (u)
* 1034 (u)
* 1164
* 1162
* 1242
* 1208
* 1176

two of these were found (u)nattached

These tags were placed in a cluster in the SE corner of the entrance meadow, by a big conifer tree, west of ribar.

Saw untagged yv plants outside of plots 1, 25 (two), and 44. Wondering if I should start tagging plants if they are outside of the plot (perhaps including them in analysis only if there are no other plants present). 

### Jun 14 2020

Visited all plots today (60s, 40s, 20s, 10s). Some of the plants in the NW and E meadow are starting to flower and yellow out (respectively). Very cool!

For plots with no flowering plants - thinking about including plants within a small distance (currently measured as from end of clipboard to the start of the handle-hole) of one of the flags. If there is exactly one within a flag, include it with a note that it is outside and the flag it is closest to (by cardinal direction). If there are multiple, take only the one that is closest to a flag. Only include these in analysis if there are no flowering plants in the plot. The resolution of the DEM is small enough that these will appear as having the same light environment in a model.

Related to above, there are a couple of plots (e.g., I think plot #2) which have some pre-tagged bad looking plants but I tagged an outside plant just in case. Ugh! Wish I hadn't done that pre-tagging.

I saw a couple of pre-tagged plants which flowered but the flowers look awful, as do some of the plants themselves (e.g., short). I am coming around to the opinion that tags are harmful. I checked on the seven tagged plants in the corner of the entrance meadow and, while it's difficult to tell for sure, a couple (but not all) of them look a little damaged.

Thoughts about the way I am counting infloresences: this is good for knowing the number of infloresences open at any one time (like... that is what I am recording) but this actually doesn't necessarily tell us the overall number of flowers per plant (for fitness). It's risky to do this by waiting to count all of the "done" plants; consider adding a "peduncle" column to the datasheet. But how often to count these? Not sure.

Thoughts on salvaging the data if the tagging is a problem: just count and assess seeds after the fact and use this to test for a difference in seed set with light. Do this by having the solar radiation model up and running and sampling along the light gradient. Here, sample plots and collect seeds in the plots.

### Jun 21 2020

Headed up today. Hadn't been up for a week due to car issues and bad weather. Rented a car from Budget. Likely won't be able to get reimbursed. Ugh.

Saw more flowering today. This is good. Lots of plants in the open areas of the SW meadow are done although there are still plenty that are open. Julian says this is one of the best (and earliest) years he has seen for Thermopsis. No signs of Campanula thus far.

Note that peduncles are insanely fragile. This means that basic handling with hands will break things off. Use pencils? Thinking about *Campanula* - this probably won't work. Perhaps can tag individual *racemes* and then track flowers at the raceme-level. Number flowers as they go up the raceme - they should open in a consistent order.

Tried a new datasheet method today. I really liked it! Pre-print out the old records (with most recent for each plant). There is a script for generating these in the `notes` directory.

Really having trouble distinguishing plants from each other when they are nearby, i.e., distinguishing which stems are of plant A and which are of plant B.

Some of the plots in the east meadow were rushed due to rain. I recorded these on the back of a datasheet. There may be one untagged yv plant outside of a plot but there shouldn't be anything important missing. It cleared up soon and I was able to correctly record info for the remaining plants.

Collected three tags today (will note soon).

Other species today: wallflowers, paintbrushes, pseudocymopt..., 

### Jun 24 2020

Did not put out twist ties today. Thinking the method I was using for tracking individual flowers was not good. For one thing, the twist ties fall off. This also simply won't work for Campanula - they are too fragile and the morphology is not ideal for twist ties.

Saw some *Campanula* today! Just the basal leaves, although I saw one with an elongated stem. There is some in open areas but a lot is in the shaded area, specifically in areas with a lot of pine needles. Is this due to moister soil? Or, is this due to the lack of competition from other plants (soil here is more open - less competition for light)? Perhaps *Campanula* has to leaf out earlier in shadier areas in order to acquire enough light to flower? You can see some in the aspens and also by plots 27 and 47. 

Seeds of the *Thermopsis* are looking close to done. How will I know when to collect them? Are there plants in the foothills I can sample?

The tag experiment. Five plants did not flower. Two-three of these plants look pretty bad (leaves a little wilted). One flowered.

### Jun 27 2020

Collecting seeds will be difficult. A lot have already dropped in 48. Think about maybe designing a device which can collect seeds? Dusty Gannon had an idea on this for his *Aquilegia*, but there the floral morphology is more suited to this type of stuff. Maybe put out a little dish or something to collect the seeds? But then we won't know which are which.

No evidence that *Campanula* is advanced at all.

I am pretty convinced the effect is real! Seeing a lot of yellow emerging in the aspens and also in the pine plots (especially in the SW meadow). We may even have enough plants to find an effect this year.

Thinking about which effects we can find... it would be interesting to also look at duration of flowering. One thing that could produce an effect here is the *time to pollination*. My sense, due to the fact that flowers shrivel asynchronously, is that they stay open until they are pollinated. So in essence what we could be seeing is just less pollination in shaded areas. This would also maybe mean fewer seeds. If there were fewer seeds in later shaded plants but not in later open-canopy plants, that would be interesting! Think about implications here.

I think it would be good to get a UROP or undergraduate/CC student of some sort to look at differences in leaf traits, height, etc. in different light environments. Could do a lot of fun things in this system and more help would be good!

Car troubles are back. Thinking about moving to a four-day schedule to minimize costs of rental cars (also gas).

### July 1 2020

Went today an ego carshare car - borrowed 7:30 - 1:30, left town at 7:50, got back to the car's parking spot at 1:26! 

I changed up the datasheet generation script a little bit and therein found a bug which explained why certain plants weren't appearing in the pre-made datasheets. The problem was that I had a boolean in there for plants where the two most recent entries were had zero spreading plants. But plants with *only one record* got an NA here and therefore were filtered out. This is fixed in the new script. I also added a "-9" to the spread and done columns for plants that are done and visited twice. This was helpful!

In retrospect it perhaps is not necessary to visit done plants twice. Due to time constraints today there were a handful of done plants which I did not look incredibly thoroughly for because this was the second visit. I will keep this in mind for the future.

Still some plants coming out in the shaded plots. Hell yeah! I am absolutely convinced that this effect is real.

Noticed today that I forgot to visit plot 29 last time (June 27). This means the start of flowering was missed - seven day uncertainty period instead of three or four. I visited it today.

Biggest news: saw some Campanula flowering today. I saw the first one (a single flower) between plots 11/12 and 21. I also saw several between plots 44/45 and 46/48 near the crest of the hill to the west of the tree. There were a bunch here. There will be more soon. The ones that I saw typically only had something like 1-3 flowers per infloresence but multilple infloresences. Things are getting real! I skimmed for some *Campanula* in some plots and saw basal leaves in plots 2, 5, 11, 18, 22, 23, 28, 29, 33, 34 and 43.

I did a brief skim in the sparsely-shaded area between the three meadows (W of the aspen stand). No *Campanula* there - consider adding plots in here.

Thinking about other projects here: it's not a perfect correlation, but there are a lot of broad-leaved *Thermopsis* plants in shaded areas. I think these are taller too (think: the aspen stand, plot 27). This is worth studying! It would be an interesting fitness trade off. Could be a great study for an undergraduate.

Other plants around: lots of lupines (lots!), wallflowers are still out, saw a new penstemon (some white, some purple), a few Allium, Cinquefoils. There is still Mertensia out (including in the shade). Saw two Dodecatheons in the NW meadow. Saw some swallowtail butterflies on wallflowers (!). 

### July 5 2020

Short-ish day today. Got rained on when I first arrived. Day got cut short towards the end because of a storm threatening to the North (was probably fine but I played it safe).

Still a couple of YV plants emerging in shaded plots. Some plots are totally done now (e.g., 48). I think I will get flowering plants in super-shaded plots 51 and 69 (dope!)

*Campanula* is open in the plots! This is good. I pre-emptively tagged one outside of plot 48. There are also a couple flowering in plots 1 and 6 and one with purple visible (`pv` in notes) in plot 2. In general, flowers are emerging in all three of the meadows (although not the semi-shaded area west of the aspen stand). The most seems to be (again) in the SW meadow, including running up the main part of the meadow where plots 48 - 50 are. There also appears to be quite a big in the E meadow. Very cool.

I'm starting tags starting at 1501 for the *Campanula*. Under this numbering system, plants 1001 - 1500 are *Thermopsis* while plants 1501 - 2000 are *Campanula*. I should have a lot of tags left over for next year.

I laid out a couple of extra plots today: 71-74. I used Julian's yellow flags for this. These I put out in the SW corner of the E meadow, in the stand of trees that cleaves the E meadow from the meadow to its south. I put out single flags for marking in the future (fingers crossed). These plots are in the semi-shaded area between the aspen stand and the SW and NW meadows. I checked today and there were no flowering plants in these today. I was going to lay out these plots using the quadrat but the threatening storm made me put this off for four days.

### July 9 2020

Plenty of *Campanula* today in open areas. I don't think there will be nearly as much as the *Thermopsis* but there should still be plenty for the study. Any possibility of pollen limitation? The East meadow looks like it has the most (and certainly has the most flowering in plots so far), the Northwest meadow has some but not a ton, and the main part of the Southwest meadow has a good spread but it's also a little sparse.

Tracking individual stems with ribbons - I tried this on one plant and it was a massive pain in the neck. Twist ties might work. Consider this if we are doing more serious sequencing next year. The flowering period of *individual plants* seems short enough that I don't think we should be to concerned about the resolution of plants. There are a handful of flowers today which were shriveled today but may not have been caught on the 5th.

I think it's a good idea to have a separate data collection and entry/storage protocol for each species. Set this up tomorrow or the day after.

I realized today that inconsistent spacing for *Thermopsis* observations, which likely requires a resampling procedure (imputing start/end days) to capture observation uncertainty, likely precludes a linear modeling approach which handles spatial autocorrelation. Is there a way to incorporate spatial autocorrelation into MC-resampling procedures? Think about this. Ask Brett.

I put out new plots today: 75 - 78 are in the bridge meadow and open areas in the pines to the North. 81 - 88 are placed in the 50-50 pine/shade area directly to the west of the aspen stand. All plots were put out with yellow flags. Note that if there is any bias incurred by putting out these plots, they likely make tests/estimates *conservative*, because these plots are put out where there are no flowering plants, and so far there are only flowering plants in open areas. Also, in terms of justifying/describing this in a paper, it's plausible to say no *Campanula* was flowering within at least ten meters (usually more) of any of the new plots. I think this puts us at 56 *Thermopsis* plots (although a number are empty so perhaps only 40 - 45) and 72 *Campanula* plots.

Most of the *Thermopsis* is done. There are a good number of plants with good looking seeds intact. Some seeds are huge! There is actually a lot of variation in the size of seeds - some look like peapods (makes sense), others are very small. I wonder if this is a sign of number of seeds?

I *think* alpine pussytoes is out. Either that or pearly everlasting. Check these (actually don't have to - not that important). Also there is some of the white *Castilleja* in the aspen grove... there are only a few of these, could be good for doing a smaller study. Collect *Castilleja* seeds!

There is some stem elongation occurring in *Campanula* in shady areas. Maybe the effect here will be weaker? Having some floral overlap would still be cool for looking at seed relatedness - there is still some overlap here that is possible.

### July 13 2020

Still thinking that the light effect on *Campanula* - if it exists, it is less strong and/or consistent than with *Thermopsis*. Definitely seeing some plants (in high volume) emerging in some shaded plots (e.g., plot 53). 

Floral development for *Campanula* is very fast. Some plants have first flowers emerge and finish in the four day period. Some plants are missed; just know that they opened and flowered at some point. Trying to assign the male/female stages here will be tricky.

Likewise, the flowering here is a little more intermittent. There are a couple of plants with a flower that has finished and no other open flowers, but clearly buds on the way. This means that randomization procedures for accounting for observation error will have to allow for non-consecutive flowering periods. Seems like this will introduce a lot more uncertainty for synchrony measures.

I tried counting only rosettes. It was hard. Plot 6 made me give up. So I am using guesswork - use the massive (9 rosette) plant in plot 6 as a guide.

### July 17 2020

Afternoon trip today (car trouble) - started surveys around noon. Started up top today (60s, 80s, 40s/50s, 30s/20s, 00s/70s). 80s plots have a lot of Campanula in them (although no flowering yet). Cha-ching!

For questionable *Campanula* plants, I did some measuring of inter-plant distances. 8cm distance between rosettes seems to be like two different plants. I am more inclined to lump somewhat distant rosettes together if they have multiple tall stems with many flowers. Didn't get to do this too many times because I lost the ruler. I think I lost it between plot 52/53 and 22.

The criterion I've adopted for whether a *Campanula* plant is open or not is whether the five petals have split/separated/spread at the tips. Thre are some plants with pollen open but they haven't fully opened yet; seems like it would be hard for a bee to climb in there... There is one plant (maybe plot 25?) without spread petals that I may have classified as flowering.

There are lots of flowers which are shrivelling but not looking to seed yet. Look at the guide or online for seeding; I remember the JoE article ahd some detail on collection.

Saw a moose (?) today in the NE meadow. I was coming in from plot 33 and it was standing around plots 29/30. I hid in the trees and made noise to scare it off. Didn't get a good look! Also, I saw a deer when collecting seeds (see below). Are there wildlife cams up there? Oh no...

I collected 15-20 *Thermopsis* fruit in the southern meadow (south of SW). Perhaps a good method is to twist seed heads gently - if you are primarily twisting the fruit instead of the peduncle then I bet the seed is ready to go. Not sure how many seeds there are or how ready these were to go. Looks like there are still a good number of seeds up there.

I think *Thermopsis* is done today. Still some plants to check to get the second zero. Begin improving and analyzing data.

### August 6 2020

Wasn't taking notes recently due to time constraints imposed by rental vehicles. Now I have a new car. Good stuff.

Ideas for analysis/questions to answer in a first-round paper.

1) Start of flowering (this could easily be answered with Geoff's multinomial method)
2) Duration of flowering (first to last day - how long is it?) Inspired by listening to an ESA talk. Here, would it make sense to exclude grazed plants? Possibly doing some selection there.
3) Day-by-day synchrony (i.e., if sampling on N days, have N pairwise synchrony measurements for each plant)

The third metric would illustrate the point that start of flowering is not an excellent proxy for *Campanula* because of the intermittent flowering that the same plants do throughout the season, although there is some resolution loss.

Lots of grazing is happening, especially in plots 32/33. Saw bear scat today around plot 32 - seemingly between plots 22 and 53. What determines the probabilty of being grazed in a given day? Time of year/season? Flowering stage? Display size? Likewise there was some sort of disturbance at plot 18 (maybe becuase of the hillslope).

Argosteris (?) - up and down. Appeared and finished in the last week. That was quick.

Tall stipa-like grass... light competition only when in a thick mat? Clonal or vegatative growth would be advantageous here if competition was nonlinear or featured density dependence (e.g., if a thick mat was needed to get that competitive effect).

### August 10 2020

Lots of grazing is still happening. Bear is still active. Mountain lion scat on the trail by one of the entrances.

For analysis, I really think onset of flowering is only part of the story. You may have first day of flowering advanced, but if individuals are throwing up flowers throughout the year, mating opportunities will change. I don't have a good sense from the data if the synchrony will actually vary, or if there is any signal of light environment here. 

On the above note, can Geoff's multinomial model be made hierarchical w/ individuals within populations (or in our case plots)? Here, each individual *new flower* is a sample from an individual's multinomial distribution, which is itself coming from a population-mean multinomial. Maybe a_{ij} ~ N(a_i, sig_a^2) and likewise for b_{ij} for plant j in plot i?

### August 14 2020

Okay, still a lot of grazing is happening. It's very frustrating. How to handle this in analysis? Including these plants may show that certain effects exist (e.g., beginning of flowering is important) but that other constraints (like herbivory) may negate (or enhance!) effects. I'm not sure.

Some time ago (august 6 maybe?) I began dropping plants out either if they were gone/lost or if they hadn't changed in the last several weeks (today: no changes after July 28). A problem with the latter of these is that plants that are grazed/drop seeds/break stems will have their number of flowers go down - this means they won't drop out and I will continue to (somewhat needlessly) check on them. I did wrote a code chunk which filters out plants where the total number of flowers increases. However, if you have grazing *and* increased flowering you're likely to not make it through this filter. Ugh. Guess I'll continue the useless checking.

Seriously collecte seeds dude.

### August 27 2020

(n.b. collected also on August 19 and August 23 but didn't take notes)

Today was the first day I used a more selective filter for which plants to visit. I visited 20-30 plants with one of the following characteristics: (1) any flowers visible sice August 10, (2) an increase in the overall number of done flowers since August 10, or (3) any "pv"s in notes since August 10. I'll apply this for future sampling periods with a moved-up sampling date.

I saw 2-3 new flowers today. One was for a plant which I don't think has flowered in a while (I think plant 1531; it was definitely in plot 45) - this means flowering after several weeks is rare but not impossible. There was also a new plant in plot 32 (maybe tag 1890? or 1830?) which had a new done flower. This may have been a previous miss (there were two stems coming out of the same rosette, two different lengths (think of a letter J with a flower on each end). Am I missing these on other plants too? I only checked this plant because it had flowered recently. Is this introducing bias?

The *Campanula* data is going to be messy and uncertain. Is it worth trying to do a thorough synchrony analysis? There is also the issue of grazing. Ugh.

The NW meadow had a lot of flags moved/disturbed. One plot had all four flags removed (I think 28). Not sure what was doing this. There was fresh-ish (2-3 days?) bear scat one or two sampling days ago but none that I saw ths time.

There also looks to be a lot of gopher activity in the meadows these days. Plants that disappear may be subsumed into mounds (or eaten).

I collected seeds today. I collected some Campanula in the large SSW meadow. Mostly in the open areas. I read earlier in the day about the morphology of seeds/fruit: the action is all happening in the capsule that is above the wilted petals (when the petals are facing down). Wait until this turns *brown* before picking. A lot of the ones on the ground had little holes poked where presumably someone got in and ate the seeds. Very cool! Also collected some *Thermopsis* in small, remote meadows to the south. You can see these on Google maps. These meadows are small and it would be interesting to do a genetic analysis...

I met Dr. Molly Nepokroeff from CU Denver in the meadows. She was leading a Flora of Colorado group through the meadows on a collecting trip. Very cool. She described CU Denver as a George Mason-type commuter school with lots of first generation and/or non-white students. This sounds very good - try to reach out to these students for research opportunities.
