# Field notes

### May 30 2020

Established 36 plots today in the three complexes: 

- 1 - 12 in the plot closest to the MRS campus

- 21 - 33 in the northwest corner meadow

- 41 - 51 in the southwest meadow

Was going to lay out a couple more in the shade in the southwest but weather got bad. The final plots I put out were in the sun. Plots 1-6, 22, 23-28, and 47-51 were placed in spots designated on a map on May 29. The remainders were placed strategically to maximize the span of light availability.

There were plants flowering in the NW complex, but otherwise, no signs of flowering. No flowering in plots. A couple of plants I tagged because the yellow of the infloresences was startig to emerge from the buds. Aspens were probably 1/3 of the way leafed out.

### Jun 2 2020

Checked on old plots today. Established plots 13-20, 34, 52-53 in complexes consistent with the numbering scheme. Total number of plots is now 47. I visited all prior plots.

I had been tagging all plants with buds. However, I ran out of tags by plot 49. Old tags stayed in place, which is good!

Saw one flowering plant in plot 46 and two flowering in plot 48.

Aspens were probably 75% of the way leafed out today. Less leafing in the very large stand in the middle of the study area.

Saw two large mammals. Maybe moose? My mind's eye remembers them as camels... they looked kinda large for deer but they moved somewhat similar to deer.

##### Things to fix

It's a good idea to differentiate between plants presenting pollen with those spreading fruit. Make two columns in the data sheet.

How to follow twist-tied plants? Probably should do different form for these.

Make plots in aspen shade? Can do it around plot 42.
