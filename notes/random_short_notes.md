# Shade Project Ideas, Sparse Notes

File for keeping random notes, thoughts, etc. related to the shade project.

##### Scale of pollination, spatial scales of variation. (May 23, 2020)

Brett mentioned it's a good idea to think about the polliation biology and the scale of pollen movement in the Elk Meadows. This is good information which informs any genetic analysis. It is difficult to know a priori, because we don't know very much about most of the movement of most of the pollinators at the MRS (although perhaps some work at RMBL, e.g. Jane Ogilvie's work with bumblebees, can be helpful for come pollinators). 

It may be a good idea to sample a couple of plants from distant parts of the meadow as a sort of out-group in a genetic comparison. Thinking on the space-time plane, you would want points that are distance in space, spread throughout time. These probably don't need to be systematically sampled, but they can be picked, monitored, and have their seeds collected for potential sequencing for incorporation into a genetic analysis.

##### Temporal trends in pollination visitation. (May 23, 2020)

Ask Julian for pollinator visitation data. Jennifer Ison's 2018 paper showed declining visitation for one species of plant over time. Does any of our analysis of offspring, seed set, etc. assume that pollination is constant over the course of the season? What would temporal trends in pollinator abundance/visitation mean if there was a delayed flowering under shade? Means that light environment makes plants less/more likely to be visited, shut out of mating, etc.
