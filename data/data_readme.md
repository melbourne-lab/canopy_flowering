# Data directory readme

Readme initialized June 24.

Storing data collected in here. Right now it's set up just to house 2020 data, but it could house more data later.

I was originally storing all data in `data_active.csv`. However, starting June 21, I began printing out data sheets with lists of plants to check (I have been calling these "active plants"). This sped up the data collection and entry process. It also provided a file to enter data into; these files, dated by when the data was collected, are stored in the root of this directory. 

The directory `data/datasheet_generation` has scripts which make and prepare datasheets and lists of plants. These are running lists - processing data is mostly done through piping which is easily modifiable. 

Soon I will add scripts for synthesizing and improving raw data.
