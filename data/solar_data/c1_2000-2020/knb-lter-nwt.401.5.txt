    Climatological data were collected from the C1 climate station on Niwot Ridge (3018 m elevation) throughout the year. From 2000-06-24 to 2013-03-25, data were recorded using a Campbell Instruments CR23X data logger. Starting 2013-03-27, data were recorded using a Campbell Instruments CR1000 data logger. Maximum and minimum values were recorded instantaneously, with a sampling interval of 5 seconds. Daily means and totals were calculated from 17,280 individual measurements. The CR23X logger was programmed to generate both hourly and daily output. The CR1000 logger generated daily, hourly, and minute data until 2014-09-10, when these time periods were discontinued and only 10 minute raw data were collected.

      The documentation section of this file was developed from the NWT LTER Cr21x data file metadata, as well as personal communication with Mark Losleben. The data file was put under sccs control on 2 December 2002.[TMA 02 December 2002] Data for 2002 were appended on 1 December 2004.[TMA 01 December 2004] Data for 2003 and 2004 were appended on 6 January 2006.[TMA 06 January 2006] Data for 2005 and 2006 were appended. [TMA 05 February 2008] Removed duplicate data line for JD 284 in Year 2000.[TMA 05 March 2000] Data for 1 January 2007 through 7 September 2008 were appended to the data section.[TMA 9 February 2009] Data for 1 January 2008 through September 2008 were replaced and data for 1 January 2009 through December 31 2010 were appended to the data section.[HCH 4 November 2011] 2010 data were replaced to correct a formatting problem with max temperature and time of max temperature.[HCH 3 February 2014] Data for 1 January 2011 through December 31 2013 were appended to the data section. Comments were added concerning the addition of cr1000 data to complete 2013 data. The abstract and comments were rewritten to reflect current IM practice and replacement of CR23X logger by CR1000.[HCH 28 January 2015] The labels were shortened and definitions added.[HCH 21 November 2015] Corrected units designation for vwc variables.[HCH 16 January 2016] Data for 2014 were appended. All “time of” variables were removed except time of max wind speed. Max and min variables for soil temp and vol water content were also removed for consistency with 10 minute variables from which daily data were calculated starting 01 December 2014.[HCH 19 January 2016] Temperature units changed to celsius.[HCH 27 April 2017] Snow depth amounts of 2.884 m (indicating blowing snow) were set to missing. Total precipitation was recalculated for 2000 to 2006. The method previously used to calculate some values (e.g. 2002) could not be determined and values appear to be incorrect. Flag columns were added. Standard deviation of wind direction was omitted because the GCE Toolbox doesn't calculate standard deviation for angular variables. Soil moisture profile (previously vwc) variables were renamed.[HCH 23 February 2018] Data for 2014 through 2016 were appended; variables, keywords, methods, and columns were updated.[HCH 22 April 2018] Metadata corrected to reflect units for the soil moisture profile of percent (not percentPerHundred) and to clarify that the units of soilmoist_5cm_avg are decimalFraction (need to be multipled by 100 to arrive at a percentage); values of #VALUE! were replaced with NaN.[SCE 12 Dec 2018].Niwot metadata converted via script to EML[SCE 2018-12-20]. Columns for new airtemp and rh measurements (hmp1, hmp2, hmp3) were added (note flagging of these new sensors has not been extensively tested and some issues may remain, notably with hmp2). Data for 2017 and 2018 were appended [SCE 2019-07-15]. Corrected EML root node; data unchanged [SCE 10 Oct 2019].  Data for 2019 were supplied by Jen Morse and appended, metadata notes and sensor information added to methods [ATW 10 April 2020].  Data for 2020 were appended, including new snow depth variables [JM/SCE 18 March 2021].

          For data collected prior to March 2013, raw data files were archived in /data2/Datman/Rawarchive/Cr23x on the NWT LTER server.
          Prior to February 2010, the information from a web documentation form was incorporated into /data2/Datman/Rawarchive/Cr23x/C1CR23X.TXT. A copy of the raw file was then processed to separate hourly from daily records; hourly records were archived in /data1/Datman/Climdata/Cr23x/Hourly/Archive. Copies of the daily data files were provided to the climatologist for quality-checking. The information provided by the climatologist was then entered into the web documentation form and appended to the C1CR23X.TXT file, and used to modify daily values for incorporation into this data set. Beginning in February 2010, the climatologist provided yearly/sub-yearly quality control information in Word documents that were the basis for modifying daily data values for this data set. CR23X hourly outputs were based on 5 second sample intervals, with 720 individual values.
          In March 2013, the CR23X logger was replaced with a CR1000 logger. Daily, hourly, and minute data were collected and archived in /data2/Datman/Rawarchive/Cr1000 on the NWT LTER server through 10 September 2014.  Beginning 10 September 2014, only 10 minute data were collected, and daily and hourly values were generated from 10 minute data using the GCE Data Toolbox. Flag columns were added at this time. All flag column values were set to "n" for 2000 through 9 September 2014 because no QAQC flagging was conducted during this time. Flag values: n=no flag; m=missing; q=questionable; e=estimated.
          All total precipitation values were calculated as current day's maximum minus previous day's maximum; value set to zero if previous max &amp;amp;gt; current max.
          Comments provided by Mark Losleben: soil moisture is relative only, the instrument has not been calibrated.

          Snow depth in meters measured with a Campbell Scientific CS SR50Alocated behind C1 shelters adjacent to NADP collector and Geonorprecipitation gage. The current sensor is mounted at a height of 3.14meters from ground. (SR50A sensor replaced previous SR50A on 20201009,mounted at 3.21 meters above ground surface. SR50A replaced previousfall 2014, mounted 2.8838 meters from ground surface).
          Sentek EnviroSMART soil profile sensor located to the north west of GCshed at c1.Volumetric Water content (soilmoistureprof) is reported as% (mm water per 100mm soil). Computed from scaled frequencies withstandard equation from manufacturer. Sensors on profile are located atdepths of 10cm, 20cm, 30cm, 50cm, 70cm, 100cm, 150cm, and 200cm belowground surface.
          Panel Temp of data logger in degrees C. Data logger is located insideGC shed at C1.
          Battery Voltage minimum in volts from battery powering data loggerlocated inside GC shed at C1.
