Looking at effects of light environment on flowering, fitness, and mating at the Mountain Research Station.

### Description

Housing notes, scripts, data, etc. related to a field project at the Mountain Research Station during Summer, 2020. 

For this project, I will be assessing the effects of canopy (shading, light environment, etc.) on the flowering times, fitness, and possibly the genetic structure of *Thermopsis divaricarpa* and *Campanula rotundifolia*.
