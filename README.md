# canopy_flowering

Looking at effects of light environment on flowering, fitness, and mating at the Mountain Research Station.

### Description

Housing notes, scripts, data, etc. related to a field project at the Mountain Research Station during Summer, 2020. 

For this project, I will be assessing the effects of canopy (shading, light environment, etc.) on the flowering times, fitness, and possibly the genetic structure of *Thermopsis divaricarpa* and *Campanula rotundifolia*. 

### Repo Structure

Folder currently contains the following directories:

`notes` - for containing meeting notes, field notes, etc.

### Updates

2020-05-22 Repo created, initialized with `notes` folder.

2020-06-24 At some point in the last two weeks I made a `data` folder for housing data, improvements to data, scripts for generating and handling data, etc.
