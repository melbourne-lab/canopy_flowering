### Pole mount
* Electrical conduit, galvanized 1" EMT (10' for $10.40) = $5.20
	* Cut to 1.2m (Home Depot will do this for free)
* 4" x 1/4" plywood disc (< $1)
* rebar (12 mm x 30 cm) = $1
* Hose clamp (25 mm/1"; 1/2" nut) = ~$1.50
* 5/32" Polypro braided cord ($2.98 for 75') = $1
* Cable ties 11" x 4 ($12 pack 100) = $0.50
* Cable ties for cable tidying 6" x 4 = $0.50
* 3 tent pegs (7 mm x 20 cm) = $3
* Stand for radiation sensor complete with level
* Total: $13

### Basic design
* Pole height 1.2 m
* Plywood pole stopper -  5/8" hole off center
	* second hole drilled for TEROS cable
* 3 tie downs at 45 degrees from top of pole, each 2.5 m (hypotenuse is 1.7 m), ends heat sealed
* Double up two pairs of 11" cable ties to attach logger housing to pole
* Extra cable ties to tidy cable

### Installation
* **Tools required**
  * Sturdy hammer for rebar and tent pegs
  * 1/2" ring spanner for sensor bracket and U-bolt
  * Flat blade screwdriver for sensor screw
  * Micro screwdriver for sensor cable connection to logger
  * Spirit level
  * Compass
  * Tape measure
  * Side cutters or pliers to trim cable ties
* Hammer in rebar at desired position, leaving about 10 cm exposed
  * In 2021, this can be installed on SE corner of each plot
* Install TEROS sensor
  * Exhume dirt (spade's width by ~10cm, 10cm deep) 30cm (1ft) south of rebar
  * Install sensor part of unit 6 cm below soil surface, with three needles parallel to ground
  * Pull ferrite core and some slack down in to the pit
  * Using hands or shovel, dig shallow (~2cm deep) trench between sensor pit and rebar
  * Bury TEROS cord in trench, cover with dirt
* Thread TEROS cord through the second (smaller) hole in the stopper
* Slip the plywood stopper over the rebar through the hole in the stopper
* Slip the hose clamp over the rebar
* Attach sensor mounting bracket to the pole at the tip
* Orient the pole on the SE side of the rebar with the sensor plate pointed toward NE
* Attach the pole to the rebar with the hose clamp 
* Set a tent peg at 1.2 m NE of the pole and attach a tie down
* Loop tie down over the sensor bracket U-bolt, around the pole, and back up through the U-bolt
* Adjust tie down until pole is vertical using a level
* Set the other two tent pegs 1.2 m at 120 degrees from first tie down
* Attach tie downs to the U-bolt using a half hitch knot
* Adjust tie downs so pole is vertical and all tie downs are very tight
* Adjust screws on sensor plate until bubble shows level
* Screws should be first screwed 2 mm in to ensure the spring is engaged
* Attach the sensor with cable oriented toward north
* Thread TEROS sensor cable through cable gland on logger box
* Setup logger
  * Attach cables (including screw terminals); TEROS 6/7 and SP510 in 0/1
  * Insert card
  * Turn logger on
  * Orient battery, mayfly board, and cables such that nothing is touching
  * Place silica gel packets
  * Apply silica grease and close box
* Use two pairs of cable ties in a criss cross pattern to attach logger box to pole about 80 cm above ground
* Ensure there is a loop of cable under the box to allow water to drip (i.e. a drip loop)
* Coil the rest of the cable and attach to the pole above the box with a cable tie
* Trim cable ties
